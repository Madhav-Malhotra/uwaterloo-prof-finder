Karen often finds inspiration from puzzles, stories and her M\u00e9tis and mixed European heritage. She has deep roots in the Red River Settlement (what is now known as Manitoba, Canada) and feels a strong connection to the M\u00e9tis, Scottish, Swedish and Finnish cultures. This mix of cultural connections sometimes creates conflicts and new perspectives which she finds both interesting and challenging. Her music reflects this cultural mix through the exploration of the sounds and stories of the Canadian prairies. She often collaborates with her M\u00e9tis mother, Joyce Clouston, who is a writer, an Indigenous Cultural Carrier, and social worker. Together they have completed numerous works that explore family stories and the intersections of Indigenous -Settler relations and philosophies. Pieces they have completed include: Mama\u2019s Painting: Louis Riel\u2019s Dream for piano quartet (2015), I Wasn\u2019t Meant for This for viola d\u2019amore and percussion (2019), English Horn Concerto: In Memory of Beverly Clouston (2019) \u2026our inner lives were entwined\u2026embroidered with the same pattern for solo piano (2021) and The Place Where the Creator Rests (2022) for piano trio and spoken voices. In demand as a composer, Karen enjoys the challenge of finding a balance between teaching, composing, performing, and keeping up with her favourite science fiction and fantasy series. Karen\u2019s compositions have been commissioned and premiered by the Montreal Metropolitan Orchestra, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, the Regina Symphony Orchestra, Park Sounds, Andromeda Trio, the Indigo Trio, and many other ensembles and solo artists.

Karen often finds inspiration from puzzles, stories and her M\u00e9tis and mixed European heritage. She has deep roots in the Red River Settlement (what is now known as Manitoba, Canada) and feels a strong connection to the M\u00e9tis, Scottish, Swedish and Finnish cultures. This mix of cultural connections sometimes creates conflicts and new perspectives which she finds both interesting and challenging. Her music reflects this cultural mix through the exploration of the sounds and stories of the Canadian prairies. She often collaborates with her M\u00e9tis mother, Joyce Clouston, who is a writer, an Indigenous Cultural Carrier, and social worker. Together they have completed numerous works that explore family stories and the intersections of Indigenous -Settler relations and philosophies. Pieces they have completed include: Mama\u2019s Painting: Louis Riel\u2019s Dream for piano quartet (2015), I Wasn\u2019t Meant for This for viola d\u2019amore and percussion (2019), English Horn Concerto: In Memory of Beverly Clouston (2019) \u2026our inner lives were entwined\u2026embroidered with the same pattern for solo piano (2021) and The Place Where the Creator Rests (2022) for piano trio and spoken voices. In demand as a composer, Karen enjoys the challenge of finding a balance between teaching, composing, performing, and keeping up with her favourite science fiction and fantasy series.

Karen often finds inspiration from puzzles, stories and her M\u00e9tis and mixed European heritage. She has deep roots in the Red River Settlement (what is now known as Manitoba, Canada) and feels a strong connection to the M\u00e9tis, Scottish, Swedish and Finnish cultures. This mix of cultural connections sometimes creates conflicts and new perspectives which she finds both interesting and challenging. Her music reflects this cultural mix through the exploration of the sounds and stories of the Canadian prairies. She often collaborates with her M\u00e9tis mother, Joyce Clouston, who is a writer, an Indigenous Cultural Carrier, and social worker. Together they have completed numerous works that explore family stories and the intersections of Indigenous -Settler relations and philosophies. Pieces they have completed include: Mama\u2019s Painting: Louis Riel\u2019s Dream for piano quartet (2015), I Wasn\u2019t Meant for This for viola d\u2019amore and percussion (2019), English Horn Concerto: In Memory of Beverly Clouston (2019) \u2026our inner lives were entwined\u2026embroidered with the same pattern for solo piano (2021) and The Place Where the Creator Rests (2022) for piano trio and spoken voices. In demand as a composer, Karen enjoys the challenge of finding a balance between teaching, composing, performing, and keeping up with her favourite science fiction and fantasy series. Karen\u2019s compositions have been commissioned and premiered by the Montreal Metropolitan Orchestra, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, the Regina Symphony Orchestra, Park Sounds, Andromeda Trio, the Indigo Trio, and many other ensembles and solo artists.

Karen often finds inspiration from puzzles, stories and her M\u00e9tis and mixed European heritage. She has deep roots in the Red River Settlement (what is now known as Manitoba, Canada) and feels a strong connection to the M\u00e9tis, Scottish, Swedish and Finnish cultures. This mix of cultural connections sometimes creates conflicts and new perspectives which she finds both interesting and challenging. Her music reflects this cultural mix through the exploration of the sounds and stories of the Canadian prairies. She often collaborates with her M\u00e9tis mother, Joyce Clouston, who is a writer, an Indigenous Cultural Carrier, and social worker. Together they have completed numerous works that explore family stories and the intersections of Indigenous -Settler relations and philosophies. Pieces they have completed include: Mama\u2019s Painting: Louis Riel\u2019s Dream for piano quartet (2015), I Wasn\u2019t Meant for This for viola d\u2019amore and percussion (2019), English Horn Concerto: In Memory of Beverly Clouston (2019) \u2026our inner lives were entwined\u2026embroidered with the same pattern for solo piano (2021) and The Place Where the Creator Rests (2022) for piano trio and spoken voices. In demand as a composer, Karen enjoys the challenge of finding a balance between teaching, composing, performing, and keeping up with her favourite science fiction and fantasy series.

While child welfare will always need formal services and foster placements to keep children safe, the overall goal of this project is to create safety and promote the wellbeing of vulnerable children where they live, and reduce reliance on intrusive measures and formal services, by building community around them and their families. If successful, this pilot project could revolutionize child welfare in Ontario. Objectives: This project involves tracking and critically assessing the processes and impacts of implementing a new pilot initiative in child welfare, and connecting it to community development theory. Community organization: Comparative case studies of community-based water activism Mixed methods case studies of opposition to Nestl\u00e9 Waters groundwater taking for bottling in various communities in Canada and US.

From its inception as a small group of friends sharing concerns, the Water Watchers has become a leading voice on groundwater issues in Ontario, attracting international attention and stimulating regulatory change at the provincial level. Objectives: Using media and archival review, participant observation, and life-history interviews, this project aims to document and analyze the history and evolution of the Water Watchers, and to draw lessons from this case study for scholarship and practice in community organization and social change.

While child welfare will always need formal services and foster placements to keep children safe, the overall goal of this project is to create safety and promote the wellbeing of vulnerable children where they live, and reduce reliance on intrusive measures and formal services, by building community around them and their families. If successful, this pilot project could revolutionize child welfare in Ontario. Objectives: This project involves tracking and critically assessing the processes and impacts of implementing a new pilot initiative in child welfare, and connecting it to community development theory. Community organization: Comparative case studies of community-based water activism Mixed methods case studies of opposition to Nestl\u00e9 Waters groundwater taking for bottling in various communities in Canada and US. Objectives: to document the stories and strategies used by activists and their opponents in communities opposing corporate water bottling, and to draw lessons about community organization and the operations of corporate and state power from them. Funder: SSHRC Insight Development Grant Timeline: June 2021-May 2023 Environmental history: Oral history of the Water Watchers The Water Watchers (formerly \"Wellington Water Watchers\") is a volunteer-led community group that formed in 2006 in response to risks to local drinking water presented by quarrying and water bottling in the area. From its inception as a small group of friends sharing concerns, the Water Watchers has become a leading voice on groundwater issues in Ontario, attracting international attention and stimulating regulatory change at the provincial level. Objectives: Using media and archival review, participant observation, and life-history interviews, this project aims to document and analyze the history and evolution of the Water Watchers, and to draw lessons from this case study for scholarship and practice in community organization and social change.

Not only did I take ENGL 316: Canadian Drama at St. Jerome's from Dr. Ted McGee as I was deciding if I'd pursue graduate work, but also my first term as a graduate student brought me to St. Jerome's for a course in Canadian Poetry. Much of my current work both as a researcher and a teacher has been inspired by those early experiences. If I had to pick, I\u2019d say poetry is my favourite genre to study (and to write), but my interests tend to be rather broad. My M.A. thesis dealt with representations of the supernatural in Canadian Children\u2019s Literature (likely a bit inspired by the popularity of The X-files, I\u2019m afraid). I\u2019m artistic, with an undergraduate minor in Fine Arts, so my work in literary studies often deals with intersections between the visual arts and literature. For instance, my Ph.D. dissertation focussed on the use of visual experimentation by poets of the Caribbean diaspora (e.g., Kamau Brathwaite, Claire Harris, and M. NourbeSe Philip). Furthermore, my current project Artful (Un)Belonging considers how references to and/or the incorporation of the visual arts is deployed in contemporary Canadian Literature as a means of interrogating experiences of (un)belonging. I also very much value Canadian literature as something we live in the midst of; it surrounds us if we let it. As co-organizer of St. Jerome\u2019s Reading Series, which brings Canadian writers to campus for readings, I hope to play a part in letting Canadian literature have a recognized and appreciated place among us.

Namely, it has considered how writers use the formal features of their texts to manage both their own and their audience\u2019s access to, and thereby relationships with, the events and people being represented. I have also developed a focus that considers literary representations of acts of eating. This work conceives of representation of eating as explorations of power systems and dynamics. My primary project at present is one that lets me combine my interests in literary studies and the fine arts. In this project, I am exploring how contemporary Canadian writers use the visual arts to explore experiences of (un)belonging. I theorize that intersections between the visual and literary arts function to interrogate the efficacies of showing rather than, or in addition to, telling. As deployed by various authors, the visual arts become an alternate mode of communication that allows for the expression of difficult subjects for which words may fail.

Furthermore, my current project Artful (Un)Belonging considers how references to and/or the incorporation of the visual arts is deployed in contemporary Canadian Literature as a means of interrogating experiences of (un)belonging. I also very much value Canadian literature as something we live in the midst of; it surrounds us if we let it.

I have also developed a focus that considers literary representations of acts of eating. This work conceives of representation of eating as explorations of power systems and dynamics. \nMy primary project at present is one that lets me combine my interests in literary studies and the fine arts. In this project, I am exploring how contemporary Canadian writers use the visual arts to explore experiences of (un)belonging. I theorize that intersections between the visual and literary arts function to interrogate the efficacies of showing rather than, or in addition to, telling. As deployed by various authors, the visual arts become an alternate mode of communication that allows for the expression of difficult subjects for which words may fail. This project has begun with a focus on such writers as Dionne Brand, Roy Kiyooka, Fred Wah, George Elliott Clarke, and Kim Barry Brunhuber. \nMy primary project at present is one that lets me combine my interests in literary studies and the fine arts.

As an undergraduate I fell in love with medieval literature, especially Old English, and had already long been more than half in love with Romantic poetry, so I decided to do one graduate degree on each. My MA thesis was on the medieval dream visions \u201cDream of the Rood\u201d and \u201cPearl\u201d. I received a Commonwealth Scholarship and continued to live in the mystical past by pursuing my PhD at King's College, Cambridge, where I was an acolyte in the beautiful Gothic chapel. I wrote my dissertation on William Blake\u2019s central image, the human body. My preoccupation with the strange ways Blake\u2019s mythological characters come into being, and his idiosyncratic treatment of musculature and posture in his visual art, led me to explore medical contexts: eighteenth-century midwifery writing and medical illustration. This area has been a rich vein for my research ever since, as I have pursued representations of reproduction in women\u2019s poetry and medical texts, and gender and sexuality in Blake, most recently branching out (so to speak) into the sex lives of plants in the work of Erasmus Darwin (for whose Economy of Vegetation Blake produced some pretty impressive engravings). Before coming to Waterloo in 2004, I was Assistant Professor at Butler University in Indiana, and before that, Instructor at Auburn University in Alabama. I taught a range of literature and writing courses, and enjoyed the opportunity to include a broad range of texts, from the Vedas to The Getaway. At St Jerome\u2019s I\u2019m delighted to continue to teach a wide variety of material in courses such as Sex and Marriage in Literature, Editing Literary Works, and the Jane Austen course, as well as Literature of the Romantic Period. I\u2019ve taught graduate courses, on Blake and on Romanticism, botany and medicine, am on the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century graduate examination committees, and supervise graduate students working on Romantic-era texts and/or the relations between gender, sexuality, medicine, and writing. I also get to indulge my love of Canadian literature here, as I\u2019m a poetry editor for The New Quarterly, and I co-organize the Canada Council-funded Reading Series at St. Jerome\u2019s.

Areas of Graduate Supervision British Romantic literature and culture, especially: William Blake Erasmus Darwin Jane Austen Poetry Medical writing and illustration Gender and sexuality Science Religion \nPhD, CambridgeMA, McMasterBA, McMaster Extension: 28244Email: tjconnol@uwaterloo.ca Website Biography I\u2019m originally from Hamilton, and I did my BA and MA at McMaster, majoring in English with a minor concentration in Religious Studies for both degrees. As an undergraduate I fell in love with medieval literature, especially Old English, and had already long been more than half in love with Romantic poetry, so I decided to do one graduate degree on each. My MA thesis was on the medieval dream visions \u201cDream of the Rood\u201d and \u201cPearl\u201d. I received a Commonwealth Scholarship and continued to live in the mystical past by pursuing my PhD at King's College, Cambridge, where I was an acolyte in the beautiful Gothic chapel. I wrote my dissertation on William Blake\u2019s central image, the human body. My preoccupation with the strange ways Blake\u2019s mythological characters come into being, and his idiosyncratic treatment of musculature and posture in his visual art, led me to explore medical contexts: eighteenth-century midwifery writing and medical illustration. This area has been a rich vein for my research ever since, as I have pursued representations of reproduction in women\u2019s poetry and medical texts, and gender and sexuality in Blake, most recently branching out (so to speak) into the sex lives of plants in the work of Erasmus Darwin (for whose Economy of Vegetation Blake produced some pretty impressive engravings). Before coming to Waterloo in 2004, I was Assistant Professor at Butler University in Indiana, and before that, Instructor at Auburn University in Alabama. I taught a range of literature and writing courses, and enjoyed the opportunity to include a broad range of texts, from the Vedas to The Getaway.

I have been co-editing a number of essay collections with colleagues in the United Kingdom and Japan, on a variety of topics. The latest ones in progress are Austen in Asia (co-edited with Kimiyo Ogawa) and Blake Sees Jesus (another one from the dynamic duo, me and Helen Bruder). I\u2019m also co-editor of two book series for Palgrave Macmillan: Pop Music, Culture and Identity (with Steve Clark and Jason Whittaker) and Asia-Pacific and Literature in English (with Shun-Liang Chao, Steve Clark, Alex Watson, and Laurence Williams). My long-term project, slowly but surely approaching completion, is a digital edition of Erasmus Darwin\u2019s The Loves of the Plants, with former students Elizabeth Bernath and Alana Rigby.\nAusten

Dr. Chen uses basic tools such as statistical physics, field theory, neural networks, and computer simulations to study structural formation in polymers and liquid crystals. Research Interests Condensed matter physics theory Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics computer simulations Biological physics Polymers and biopolymers Condensed Matter Biochemistry and Biophysics Soft Matter Scholarly Research Soft matter is a cross disciplinary research field involving physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science. It studies physical systems that can be deformed relatively easily in response to external and internal physical and chemical conditions. Examples include colloids, polymers, gels, liquid crystals, and a number of biological systems. These materials compete with and sometimes outperform the traditional solid-state materials. Soft matter theory is a field that has seen vast new developments in the last half century, in both fundamental and applied research. My research group has built a comprehensive soft-matter-theory research program that covers a number of challenging problems in polymers, membranes, and liquid crystals. The primary thrust is to establish a fundamental understanding of the structures, states, and dynamics of soft matter systems such as semiflexible polymers, as well as liquid crystals and their defect structures. The main research tool is statistical physics, which includes scaling theory, Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations, and field-theory simulations. Example Problems Block copolymers are basic building blocks that can be used to design exquisitely tailored materials with unparalleled control over nanoscale-domain geometry, packing symmetry, and chemical composition. Semiflexibility is a factor that plays a crucial role in the conformational properties of wormlike polymer chains. Formulating as well as solving the self-consistent field theory for wormlike copolymers that take semiflexibility into account has long been known as one of the main challenges in polymer physics. We developed a numerical technique to calculate the phase diagram where semiflexibility is one of the additional tuning parameter beyond the classical phase diagram of flexible diblock copolymers.

Polym Science 54-55, 3 (2016)] In recent years, a whole body of knowledge has been generated on defect structures resulting from placing a liquid crystal within a finite geometry that frustrates the director field. The natural tendency of forming a uniform bulk nematic configuration is interrupted by the curvature of the embedded surface or boundary conditions of the confining walls. We studied the extended Onsager model that contains identifiable physical parameters instead of phenomenological parameters used in Landau-de Gennes and Frank elastic models. We theoretically presented a unified phase diagram for the evolution of defect structures from the isotropic-nematic transition to a deep nematic state, over a wide range of parameter space. For the first time, we captured the results observed in recent Monte Carlo simulations and calculated from the Frank model all within one unified physical picture. [W.-Y. Zhang, Y. Jiang and J. Z. Y.

His recent research activities have focused on \u201csmall scale\u201d formation studies of low and intermediate mass stars, circumstellar disks, and the formation of proto-solar systems. Research Interests Interstellar Medium Star Formation Structure of Galaxies Instruments needed to carry out research in these areas Astrophysics and Gravitation Astronomy Scholarly Research A central part of Dr. Fich's research throughout his career has been the role of HII regions and the massive stars that power them. This was part of a study of dense clouds associated with HII regions and the massive stars that power them. Other projects include: Large field imaging at submillimeter wavelengths of nearby Galactic star forming areas (e.g. Orion, Taurus, rho Oph); modeling the radiative transfer, especially of water lines, in circumstellar disks, A study of the Initial Luminosity Function and the Initial Mass Function in the outer Galaxy., A study of a spectacular molecular bipolar outflow;, A long term program of observations of cold dust in elliptical galaxies;, Theoretical models of continuum emission in the infrared and submillimeter from dust grains, especially those in or near HII regions;, A program that combines millimeter, submillimeter, and near-infrared observations in an attempt to decouple the effects of various environmental properties on the progress of star formation in dense molecular cloud cores;, Measurements of the abundances of various elements in HII regions in the outer Galaxy;, A candidate Luminous Blue Variable in the outer parts of the Galaxy.

This includes self assembly of polymers, dynamics in thin films and near surface and interfaces. He has a long standing interest on the dynamics of glassy materials. Research Interests Physics of soft materials Physics of polymer thin films Crystalline polymers Polymer interfaces and adhesion Confinement of polymer chains Glass transition in confined geometry Biomaterials, Polymers and Bioplastics Soft Matter Scholarly Research Dynamics in thin polymer films The Waterloo Polymer Physics group has made many important contributions to the study of the glass transition in thin polymer films. The general premise of such studies is that the dynamics in thin films can be significantly different from that of the bulk polymer. From an applied point of view the glass transition is an important parameter describing the temperature dependent dynamics of the system. These properties in turn largely determine which application a particular material is suited for. From a more fundamental viewpoint, thin polymer films provide excellent sample geometry for studying what are termed finite size effects in model glass forming materials. This may lead to significant advances in our understanding of this outstanding unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Our studies here have focused on measurements of the glass transition temperature, as well as more direct studies of the dynamics. We have used ellipsometry, photon correlation spectroscopy, dielectric relaxation, quartz crystal microbalance, and inelastic neutron scattering in these studies. Properties of polymer surfaces and interfaces There are a number of reasons to think that the properties of polymers may be different at interfaces and surfaces than in the bulk of a material. We have been actively involved in this area from looking at the adhesion of micron sized particles to Porous Silicon (PS) surfaces, embedding of nm sized particle to PS surfaces and looking at interface formation between miscible and immiscible blends when one of the constituents is still in a glassy state. Structural properties in thin films Structural as well dynamical properties can be different in a thin film geometry. We are interested in fundamental questions such as, \"What is the density in a thin film?\" as well as more applied questions like, \"What is the composition in blended systems, or those with impurities?\". Our studies in this are span a very wide range. We have used optical scattering techniques, microscopy, dynamics secondary ion mass spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to study these sample. Biopolymers at surfaces and interfaces Proteins have specific conformations which define their biologically active state. These configurations are typically determined by the details of interactions between the different constituent monomers as well as interactions with the aqueous solution. This delicate balance of interactions which is required to have a protein remain in a biologically active state can be significantly perturbed by the presence of interfaces. The monomer-surface interaction can potentially be much stronger than hydropobic interactions which cause the molecule to campactify and leave open the possibility not only for the protein to adsorb onto the surface but also to denature onto it. We are beginning to investigate proteins at interfaces.

In particular he is currently pursuing the use of satellites to accomplish intercontinental distances, and is possible with today\u2019s technology. His field of research combines information processing technologies with the laws of quantum physics and is at the forefront of research today, giving rise to powerful new information tools such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography. Research Interests Quantum communication and quantum computation experiments using entangled photons Quantum teleportation Orbital angular momentum of photons Long distance quantum communication via optical fibers, free space, and satellite based links Foundations of physics and quantum information, entanglement in large and complex systems Quantum Science Quantum Communication Photonics Optical Systems Satellite Payload Development Scholarly Research Dr. Jennewein is actively driving a very strong program with the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), supported by a team of academic and industrial partners, of which he is the principal investigator. The mission proposal he has established is called QEYSSat (Quantum Encryption and Science Satellite). Several projects and studies were funded by the CSA since 2010. One of the ongoing studies includes the development of the satellite payload systems.

This is the fundamental question in the field of quantum information processing (QIP). QIP is a young field with an incredible potential impact reaching from the way we understand fundamental physics to technological applications. Information processing devices are pervasive in our society - from the 5 dollar watches to multi-billions satellite network - and have allowed the information revolution which is developing around us. It has transformed not only the way we communicate or entertain ourselves, but also the way we do science and even the way we think. All this information is manipulated using the classical approximation to the laws of physics, but we know that there is a better approximation: the quantum mechanical laws Research Interests Quantum information theory and experiments Quantum error correction NMR quantum computing Quantum communication Quantum algorithms Optical quantum information processing Quantum Science Quantum Computing Quantum Information Processing Quantum Communication Scholarly Research In late 1994, after hearing of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm, Professor Laflamme quickly realized that quantum computers would be hampered by the loss of quantum coherence (i.e. decoherence). In fact if decoherence is not taken care of, quantum computers lose their power. After the seminal work of Shor and Steane, Professor Laflamme and his colleague Manny Knill laid down the mathematical foundation of quantum error correcting codes. With colleagues Miquel, Paz and Zurek, he has also discovered the most compact quantum error correcting code which corrects one quantum error. This quantum error correcting code has since been implemented using NMR, together with Knill, Negrevergne and Martinez. After having looked at error correcting codes, his attention turned to taking care of errors which would happen while we are trying to correct errors. This lead to the threshold accuracy theorem which says that it is possible to compute for as long as desired with given accuracy, with reasonable (polynomial) amount of overhead, as long as the error rate is below a threshold. It is an important discovery as it shows that imperfection and imprecision of realistic devices are not fundamental objections to quantum computing. A few years later, using the multi-disciplinary characteristic of Los Alamos National Laboratory, he learned how to use Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and collaborated with NMR spectroscopists both at Los Alamos and MIT to to better understand quantum information in an experimental setting. The thread in Professor Laflamme's research has been to understand the limitations, both in theory and in experiments, on the control we have on quantum systems. Current research projects include: Quantum information: Understanding the impact of manipulating information using the laws of quantum mechanics. Robust quantum control: Developing methods to protect quantum information against noise through quantum control and quantum error correction for quantum computing and quantum cryptography. Experimental quantum information processing: Implementing ideas and concepts of quantum information processing using nuclear magnetic resonance and developing scalable methods to control quantum systems. Quantum cryptography: Theoretical and experimental investigations focussed on using the laws of quantum mechancis to transmit secure information, in particular using satellite communication. Physical systems for quantum information processing: Developing \u201cblueprints\u201d for quantum information processors using various approaches such as linear optics quantum computing (LOQC). Simulation of quantum systems: Finding ways to simulate quantum systems using quantum information processors. Education 1988 PhD, D.A.M.T.P., University of Cambridge 1984 Part III of Math.

This is the fundamental question in the field of quantum information processing (QIP). QIP is a young field with an incredible potential impact reaching from the way we understand fundamental physics to technological applications. Information processing devices are pervasive in our society - from the 5 dollar watches to multi-billions satellite network - and have allowed the information revolution which is developing around us. It has transformed not only the way we communicate or entertain ourselves, but also the way we do science and even the way we think. All this information is manipulated using the classical approximation to the laws of physics, but we know that there is a better approximation: the quantum mechanical laws\n\nResearch Interests\n Quantum information theory and experiments Quantum error correction NMR quantum computing Quantum communication Quantum algorithms Optical quantum information processing Quantum Science Quantum Computing Quantum Information Processing Quantum Communication \n Quantum information theory and experiments Quantum error correction NMR quantum computing Quantum communication Quantum algorithms Optical quantum information processing Quantum Science Quantum Computing Quantum Information Processing Quantum Communication \nQuantum information theory and experiments\nQuantum error correction\nNMR quantum computing\nQuantum communication\nQuantum algorithms\nOptical quantum information processing\nQuantum Science\nQuantum Computing\nQuantum Information Processing\nQuantum Communication\nScholarly Research\n In late 1994, after hearing of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm, Professor Laflamme quickly realized that quantum computers would be hampered by the loss of quantum coherence (i.e. decoherence). In fact if decoherence is not taken care of, quantum computers lose their power. After the seminal work of Shor and Steane, Professor Laflamme and his colleague Manny Knill laid down the mathematical foundation of quantum error correcting codes. With colleagues Miquel, Paz and Zurek, he has also discovered the most compact quantum error correcting code which corrects one quantum error. This quantum error correcting code has since been implemented using NMR, together with Knill, Negrevergne and Martinez. After having looked at error correcting codes, his attention turned to taking care of errors which would happen while we are trying to correct errors. This lead to the threshold accuracy theorem which says that it is possible to compute for as long as desired with given accuracy, with reasonable (polynomial) amount of overhead, as long as the error rate is below a threshold. It is an important discovery as it shows that imperfection and imprecision of realistic devices are not fundamental objections to quantum computing. A few years later, using the multi-disciplinary characteristic of Los Alamos National Laboratory, he learned how to use Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and collaborated with NMR spectroscopists both at Los Alamos and MIT to to better understand quantum information in an experimental setting. The thread in Professor Laflamme's research has been to understand the limitations, both in theory and in experiments, on the control we have on quantum systems. Current research projects include: Quantum information: Understanding the impact of manipulating information using the laws of quantum mechanics. Robust quantum control: Developing methods to protect quantum information against noise through quantum control and quantum error correction for quantum computing and quantum cryptography. Experimental quantum information processing: Implementing ideas and concepts of quantum information processing using nuclear magnetic resonance and developing scalable methods to control quantum systems. Quantum cryptography: Theoretical and experimental investigations focussed on using the laws of quantum mechancis to transmit secure information, in particular using satellite communication. Physical systems for quantum information processing: Developing \u201cblueprints\u201d for quantum information processors using various approaches such as linear optics quantum computing (LOQC). Simulation of quantum systems: Finding ways to simulate quantum systems using quantum information processors. \nEducation\n 1988 PhD, D.A.M.T.P., University of Cambridge 1984 Part III of Math.

He emphasizes computational methods as a theoretical technique, in particular the development of state-of-the-art algorithms for the study of strongly-interacting systems. Dr. Melko's work has employed Monte Carlo simulations and Density Matrix Renormalization Group methods to explore the low-temperature physics of classical and quantum magnetic materials, cold atoms in optical lattices, bosonic fluids and low-dimensional systems. He is particularly involved in studying microscopic models that display interesting quantum behavior in the bulk, such as superconducting, spin liquid, topological, superfluid or supersolid phases. He is also interested in broader ideas in computational physics, the development of efficient algorithms for simulating quantum mechanical systems on classical computers, and the relationship of these methods to the field of quantum information science. Research Interests Entanglement in Condensed Matter Systems Unconventional Quantum Criticality Frustrated Quantum Magnets Supersolid and Superglass phases Quantum Monte Carlo Machine learning Condensed Matter Quantum Science Scholarly Research Dr. Melko's research tries to answer a fundamental set of questions in context of condensed-matter, quantum many-body, and quantum information theory. A non-exhaustive list of motivations might include: Are there undiscovered, interesting and (potentially) useful new states of matter to be found in nature? What are the microscopic mechanisms behind the variety of exotic phenomena observed in strongly-correlated matter? Does undiscovered and novel universal behavior exist at certain phase transitions? Can quantum systems, and all of their hosts of intriguing phenomena, be studied with classical computers? His favourite tool for research is simulation, particularly classical and quantum Monte Carlo, Density Matrix Renormalization Group methods, and numerical series expansion methods. Entanglement is a quintessential feature defining quantum physics. Einstein used a two-particle system argue that entanglement leads to \"spooky action at a distance\". The two-particle case is by now well understood, but the situation for multi-particle systems remains unclear. In most condensed-matter systems, entanglement between two regions of a multi-particle system scales as the boundary (or area) between them. This \"area law\" was first understood in the context of black hole physics, and has subsequently been demonstrated for many quantum many-body systems. Whether systems obey an area law is closely related to the feasibility of the simulation of those quantum systems on a classical computer. In our group, we study numerically the existence of laws in condensed-matter systems, as well as subleading scaling that has the potential to redefine classification schemes of condensed matter through access to universal physics. Phase transitions are fascinating because they give us a window into \"universal\" phenomena - quantitative connections that occur between very disparate natural systems, in condensed matter and beyond. Although such critical behavior is for the large part understood in classical physical systems, quantum mechanical systems offer a variety of possibilities for new manifestations of universal behavior. Some of these quantum critical points are relatively conventional, while others involve exotic phenomena such as fractionalized particles or emergent gauge symmetries. In my group we use computer simulations of realistic quantum lattice models to discover and characterize new examples of unconventional quantum critical points. These studies give a glimpse of a strange quantum world where exotic particles such as spin-charge separated electrons can be identified through universal signatures relevant for simulation, theory, or eventually, experiment. Frustration is the inability of a system to simultaneously satisfy all of its individual microscopic constraints. In classical systems, this leads to interesting collective behavior at low temperatures, such as seen in the famous examples of \"spin ice\" materials. However, when quantum fluctuations come in to play, these frustrated systems can realize a whole new level of exotica. Various types of valence bond solid (illustrated) or related states can arise when quantum fluctuations are present in a frustrated system. Most striking are the disordered \"spin liquid\" states, which are T=0 quantum collective paramagnets. These support such exotic phenomena as fractional charges, spin-charge separation, and topological order - a crucial ingredient in modern proposals to build a quantum computer from topologically protected qbits. The possible existence of a supersolid phase of Helium, first reported in 2004 by Kim and Chan, has driven experimental and theoretical work alike. The supersolid, a state that simultaneously exhibits the properties of a solid and a superfluid, would be a new phase of matter if proven to exist experimentally. Parallel to the experimental search are theoretical efforts to find candidate systems in which the Supersolid exists. At Waterloo we use a combination of analytical and numerical approaches to study a related phase, the Superglass -- a system similar to the Supersolid except that instead of a regular repeating pattern of density (defining a solid), we have a random frozen configuration (defining a glass) with coexisting superfluidity. Computational methods, and in particular Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques, are an important tool in statistical physics and are essential for advancing studies in almost all quantum condensed matter research. In systems with a large number of accessible states, the integrals associated with various expectation values become too complicated to calculate exactly, but Monte Carlo methods allow us to calculate these values numerically using statistical sampling. Our group works on developing algorithms that use various QMC techniques, such as Anders Sandvik's Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) methods. We have used these types of algorithms to study quantum many-body systems, and we have also applied these Monte Carlo simulations to studies of entropy and phase transitions in classical systems.

He emphasizes computational methods as a theoretical technique, in particular the development of state-of-the-art algorithms for the study of strongly-interacting systems. Dr. Melko's work has employed Monte Carlo simulations and Density Matrix Renormalization Group methods to explore the low-temperature physics of classical and quantum magnetic materials, cold atoms in optical lattices, bosonic fluids and low-dimensional systems. He is particularly involved in studying microscopic models that display interesting quantum behavior in the bulk, such as superconducting, spin liquid, topological, superfluid or supersolid phases. He is also interested in broader ideas in computational physics, the development of efficient algorithms for simulating quantum mechanical systems on classical computers, and the relationship of these methods to the field of quantum information science.\nResearch Interests\n Entanglement in Condensed Matter Systems Unconventional Quantum Criticality Frustrated Quantum Magnets Supersolid and Superglass phases Quantum Monte Carlo Machine learning Condensed Matter Quantum Science \n Entanglement in Condensed Matter Systems Unconventional Quantum Criticality Frustrated Quantum Magnets Supersolid and Superglass phases Quantum Monte Carlo Machine learning Condensed Matter Quantum Science \nEntanglement in Condensed Matter Systems\nUnconventional Quantum Criticality\nFrustrated Quantum Magnets\nSupersolid and Superglass phases\nQuantum Monte Carlo\nMachine learning\nCondensed Matter\nQuantum Science\nScholarly Research\n Dr. Melko's research tries to answer a fundamental set of questions in context of condensed-matter, quantum many-body, and quantum information theory. A non-exhaustive list of motivations might include: Are there undiscovered, interesting and (potentially) useful new states of matter to be found in nature? What are the microscopic mechanisms behind the variety of exotic phenomena observed in strongly-correlated matter? Does undiscovered and novel universal behavior exist at certain phase transitions? Can quantum systems, and all of their hosts of intriguing phenomena, be studied with classical computers? His favourite tool for research is simulation, particularly classical and quantum Monte Carlo, Density Matrix Renormalization Group methods, and numerical series expansion methods. Entanglement is a quintessential feature defining quantum physics. Einstein used a two-particle system argue that entanglement leads to \"spooky action at a distance\". The two-particle case is by now well understood, but the situation for multi-particle systems remains unclear. In most condensed-matter systems, entanglement between two regions of a multi-particle system scales as the boundary (or area) between them. This \"area law\" was first understood in the context of black hole physics, and has subsequently been demonstrated for many quantum many-body systems. Whether systems obey an area law is closely related to the feasibility of the simulation of those quantum systems on a classical computer. In our group, we study numerically the existence of laws in condensed-matter systems, as well as subleading scaling that has the potential to redefine classification schemes of condensed matter through access to universal physics. Phase transitions are fascinating because they give us a window into \"universal\" phenomena - quantitative connections that occur between very disparate natural systems, in condensed matter and beyond. Although such critical behavior is for the large part understood in classical physical systems, quantum mechanical systems offer a variety of possibilities for new manifestations of universal behavior. Some of these quantum critical points are relatively conventional, while others involve exotic phenomena such as fractionalized particles or emergent gauge symmetries. In my group we use computer simulations of realistic quantum lattice models to discover and characterize new examples of unconventional quantum critical points. These studies give a glimpse of a strange quantum world where exotic particles such as spin-charge separated electrons can be identified through universal signatures relevant for simulation, theory, or eventually, experiment. Frustration is the inability of a system to simultaneously satisfy all of its individual microscopic constraints. In classical systems, this leads to interesting collective behavior at low temperatures, such as seen in the famous examples of \"spin ice\" materials.

Surveys of three-dimensional galaxy positions provide a wealth of data both on the physics just after the Big-Bang when the seed fluctuations that will grow through gravity to become galaxies were created, and on the physics driving the evolution of the Universe today. \nResearch Interests\n Observational cosmology Cosmological structure formation Cosmological models Large-Scale structure Galaxy surveys Galaxy formation & evolution Astrophysics and Gravitation \n Observational cosmology Cosmological structure formation Cosmological models Large-Scale structure Galaxy surveys Galaxy formation & evolution Astrophysics and Gravitation \nObservational cosmology\nCosmological structure formation\nCosmological models\nLarge-Scale structure\nGalaxy surveys\nGalaxy formation & evolution\nAstrophysics and Gravitation\nScholarly Research\n Large international teams are required to undertake galaxy surveys, and Professor Percival helps to run a number of experiments. In particular, he holds the position of Survey Scientist in the on-going extended-Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS, www.sdss.org/surveys/eboss), and is a primary science coordinator for the future satellite mission Euclid ([http://sci.esa.int/euclid](http://sci.esa.int/euclid)). He is also working on the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI, [https://www.desi.lbl.gov/](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/)) and is involved in a number of other experiments and the use of their cosmological measurements. \nEducation\n 1999 PhD University of Oxford, Oxford, UK \n 1999 PhD University of Oxford, Oxford, UK \n1999 PhD University of Oxford, Oxford, UK\nAwards\n Chinese Academy of Sciences \"Distinguished Scientist'' fellowship 2016.

My research has most recently focused on two exciting collaborations, results of which have already been presented in conferences and published. Moreover, these results have also stimulated specifically TEM oriented research of which interdisciplinary graduate student training will be a large component. (A) Structure and high resolution images of protein aggregates, particularly SuperOxide Dismutase. The TEM analysis of SOD aggregates will form a key part of an interdisciplinary study that is based on strong evidence that a disease like ALS (Lou Gehrig's) may also be a conformational disorder caused by protein folding / misfolding. I have observed the formation SOD fibrils of diameters from about 3 to 25 nm that has already motivated us to propose a novel new mechanism for the formation of SOD aggregates in ALS. Moreover, our TEM results also revealed that the ultrasonication of proteins initiates aggregate formation, previously not realized, that may have far reaching consequences in view of its many uses, including medical. TEM research will expand on these novel findings via (i) low-dose cryo-SAED in an attempted to elucidate SOD's fine structure presently not known; (ii) further expand studies into the effects of sonication on protein aggregation. (B) Nano-structured plastics are a developing area of significance. We are preparing novel, industrially relevant polyolefin nanocomposites by using in-situ, multi-step intercalation/exfoliation and polymerization reactions of ethylene with montmorillonite (a layered silicate) treated with bifunctional modifiers. Exfoliation transforms the silicate into a nanoparticle, and the proper intercalation of several chemicals and catalysts is fundamental to achieving exfoliation. The TEM will characterize the dispersed phases of montmorillonite via cryo- SAED, CBED and EDX during each stage of the intercalation/exfoliation and subsequent polymerization reactions to establish the 'quality' of each intercalation processes, particularly that of exfoliation, actually achieved. Other interests include the physics of the intercalation reaction in low dimensional solids. Intercalation refers to the insertion of guest species in the lattice spaces provided by a host material, and is typically accompanied by a charge transfer from the guest to the host. Specifically, the effects of intercalation on: charge-density-waves (CDW) that modulate the host structure high-T layered superconductors secondary intercalation batteries.

They published this Nobel-winning research in 1985 when Strickland was a PhD student at the University of Rochester in New York state. Together they paved the way toward the most intense laser pulses ever created. The research has several applications today in industry and medicine \u2014 including the cutting of a patient\u2019s cornea in laser eye surgery, and the machining of small glass parts for use in cell phones. Strickland was a research associate at the National Research Council Canada, a physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and a member of technical staff at Princeton University. In 1997, she joined the University of Waterloo, where her ultrafast laser group develops high-intensity laser systems for nonlinear optics investigations. She is a recipient of a Sloan Research Fellowship, a Premier\u2019s Research Excellence Award and a Cottrell Scholar Award. She served as the president of the Optical Society (OSA) in 2013 and is a fellow of OSA, the Royal Society of Canada, and SPIE (International Society for Optics and Photonics). Strickland is an honorary fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering as well as the Institute of Physics. She received the Golden Plate Award from the Academy of Achievement and holds numerous honorary doctorates. Strickland earned a PhD in optics from the University of Rochester and a B.Eng. from McMaster University. Research Interests Intense laser-matter interactions Nonlinear optics Short-pulse, intense laser systems Photonics Optical Systems Scholarly Research Ultrashort pulse generation through multi-frequency Raman generation: We are investigating the nonlinear optical technique of multi-frequency Raman generation, (MRG). In MRG, a large number of Raman orders spanning from infrared to ultraviolet are generated by pumping a molecular gas with two strong pumps having a frequency separation matching the vibrational or rotational frequency. Waterloo's ultrafast laser group has developed a high intensity, two-colour, Ti:sapphire laser, which is an ideal source for studying MRG. This coherent nonlinear interaction allows the Raman orders to be phased together to generate a train of very short pulses, approaching single femtosecond durations, which can be used to make \"freeze frame\" movies of molecular motion. Two-colour fiber laser system for mid-infrared generation: The spectral region from 6 to 25\u00b5m is known as the \"molecular fingerprint region\" because almost every molecule has a distinctive signature in its absorption spectra at these wavelengths. Along with applications in environmental monitoring and medical applications, this spectral region is becoming increasingly important for trace gas detection of explosives. At Waterloo, we are developing a two-colour, short pulse fiber laser system to generate mid-infrared wavelengths across the fingerprint region by difference frequency mixing the two laser outputs in a nonlinear crystal. Currently we have generated sub-picosecond mid-infrared pulses with over 1mW of average power with wavelengths tunable from 16 to 20 \u00b5m. Self-focusing in the crystalline lens: In a collaborative project with Prof. Melanie Campbell and Prof. Joe Sanderson, we are studying the role of self-focusing and multi-photon ionization on micro-cavity bubble formation within the crystalline lens. Micromachining of the crystalline lens of the eye has become an active area of research to determine if the elasticity of the lens can be improved by creating microbubbles within the lens to possible cure the condition of Presbyopia.

Dr. Nagge\u2019s primary research interests are driven by questions routinely encountered in his clinical practice that lack solutions supported by a solid evidence base. Examples of this include the development of strategies to optimize the management of anticoagulation therapy, and evaluating the effectiveness and safety of various pharmacological alternatives for cardiovascular risk reduction. Dr. Nagge also practices as a clinical consultant at the Centre for Family Medicine Academic Family Health team in Kitchener. His clinical interests include anticoagulation, cardiovascular therapeutics, evidence-informed practice, and shared decision-making. He practices as a clinical consultant at the Centre for Family Medicine Academic Family Health team in Kitchener, where he developed several innovative clinical services including a point-of-care anticoagulation clinic, arterial and venous thrombosis clinics, and a cardiovascular risk reduction clinic. He has supervised hundreds of undergraduate and post-graduate Pharmacy and Medical learners in these clinics, and trained more than 200 practicing pharmacists, nurses and nurse practitioners in MOAT, a blended-learning, continuing education course that teaches clinicians how to manage oral anticoagulant therapy in primary care settings.

Dr. Nagge\u2019s primary research interests are driven by questions routinely encountered in his clinical practice that lack solutions supported by a solid evidence base. Examples of this include the development of strategies to optimize the management of anticoagulation therapy, and evaluating the effectiveness and safety of various pharmacological alternatives for cardiovascular risk reduction. Dr. Nagge also practices as a clinical consultant at the Centre for Family Medicine Academic Family Health team in Kitchener. His clinical interests include anticoagulation, cardiovascular therapeutics, evidence-informed practice, and shared decision-making. He practices as a clinical consultant at the Centre for Family Medicine Academic Family Health team in Kitchener, where he developed several innovative clinical services including a point-of-care anticoagulation clinic, arterial and venous thrombosis clinics, and a cardiovascular risk reduction clinic. He has supervised hundreds of undergraduate and post-graduate Pharmacy and Medical learners in these clinics, and trained more than 200 practicing pharmacists, nurses and nurse practitioners in MOAT, a blended-learning, continuing education course that teaches clinicians how to manage oral anticoagulant therapy in primary care settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n Cardiovascular risk reduction Anticoagulation therapy Translating evidence into practice Shared decision-making Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacy Practice \n Cardiovascular risk reduction Anticoagulation therapy Translating evidence into practice Shared decision-making Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacy Practice \nCardiovascular risk reduction\nAnticoagulation therapy\nTranslating evidence into practice\nShared decision-making\nClinical Pharmacy and Pharmacy Practice\nEducation\n 2004 PharmD, University of Toronto, Canada 2000 BScPhm, University of Toronto, Canada 1995 BSc (Honours Science, Minor in Chemistry), University of Waterloo, Canada \n 2004 PharmD, University of Toronto, Canada 2000 BScPhm, University of Toronto, Canada 1995 BSc (Honours Science, Minor in Chemistry), University of Waterloo, Canada \n2004 PharmD, University of Toronto, Canada\n2000 BScPhm, University of Toronto, Canada\n1995 BSc (Honours Science, Minor in Chemistry), University of Waterloo, Canada\nAwards\n 2014 Interprofessional Preceptor of the Year Award.
