I then went to Waterloo Collegiate and became interested in history under teachers like Jack Sinkins and Paul Voisin. A trip to Europe with my brother and parents in 1972 was a real rush. I couldn't get enough of those Church crypts. For no reason that I can remember I took Geography or Political Science at Wilfrid Laurier University. Doug Lorimer taught my first university history course, Twentieth Century British History. My second history course was a History of French Canada with Terry Copp. I double majored in History and Political Science, but was already leaning to the historical side when I graduated. After a trip to Europe in the summer of 1983, I started my MA under Terry Copp. I interviewed a lot of veterans of the Lincoln and Welland Regiment, and wrote a 'new' wartime history of that battalion. My uncle, James F. Swayze, DSO was an officer in the \"Lincs\" and he and I travelled around France, Belgium and the Netherlands in the fall of 1984 'researching' the book. With Terry Copp's support, that book was published in 1986 as The Lincs: A History of the Lincoln and Welland Regiment at War. I still have a close connection to the Lincoln and Welland Regiment, and to Terry Copp, who is the Director of the Laurier Centre for Military, Strategic and Disarmament Studies. To my great surprise, (and the shock of all who knew me), I won a Sir John A. Macdonald Scholarship and headed to Western where I studied the Canadian Army Officer Corps during the Second World War. A.M.J. Hyatt was my kind and patient supervisor. When I graduated from Western, I was already teaching at UW. I came on as a tenure-track departmental member in 1994. Soon after joining uWaterloo full time, I embarked on some local history. I was commissioned by the Waterloo Historical Society to write Waterloo County: An Illustrated History (1997). I also represented UW for eight years on the Board of the Waterloo Regional Heritage Foundation. My work has taken me to many places, including Europe, Jordan and Afghanistan, studying facets of Canadian foreign and defence policy. My interest in military leadership has led me to write papers for the Canadian Forces Leadership Institute. I have also co-edited two collections works, one historical, one contemporary.

I then went to Waterloo Collegiate and became interested in history under teachers like Jack Sinkins and Paul Voisin. A trip to Europe with my brother and parents in 1972 was a real rush. I couldn't get enough of those Church crypts. For no reason that I can remember I took Geography or Political Science at Wilfrid Laurier University. Doug Lorimer taught my first university history course, Twentieth Century British History. My second history course was a History of French Canada with Terry Copp. I double majored in History and Political Science, but was already leaning to the historical side when I graduated. After a trip to Europe in the summer of 1983, I started my MA under Terry Copp. I interviewed a lot of veterans of the Lincoln and Welland Regiment, and wrote a 'new' wartime history of that battalion. My uncle, James F. Swayze, DSO was an officer in the \"Lincs\" and he and I travelled around France, Belgium and the Netherlands in the fall of 1984 'researching' the book. With Terry Copp's support, that book was published in 1986 as The Lincs: A History of the Lincoln and Welland Regiment at War. I still have a close connection to the Lincoln and Welland Regiment, and to Terry Copp, who is the Director of the Laurier Centre for Military, Strategic and Disarmament Studies. To my great surprise, (and the shock of all who knew me), I won a Sir John A. Macdonald Scholarship and headed to Western where I studied the Canadian Army Officer Corps during the Second World War.

Teaching courses that require students to complete readings can be difficult. However, Kroeker compels students to complete such assignments with an interest in the material and enthusiasm as well. She uses her own enthusiasm, humour, and deep understanding of the content to encourage students to work at what they are learning. As one graduate student shares, \u201cDr. Kroeker encouraged me to continue to pursue my studies in history, thereby greatly impacting and influencing my own learning\u201d. By acting as a mentor and a motivator, Kroeker allows students to \u201cfeel safe and secure in their learning environment\u201d, and dedicates many hours to supporting them. Innovating courses that students with an outside perspective may view as content-heavy is another way Kroeker goes beyond the realms of teaching. By structuring tutorials and assigning group projects that encourage creativity, students are able to develop \u201c\u2018out of the box\u2019 thinking when presenting research information\u201d, which is an aspect an alumnus appreciated. As her fellow colleague explains, \u201cDr. Kroeker personally builds a compelling case for higher education, linking practical skills with intellectual achievement\u201d.

His research focuses on governance of complex policy areas such as climate change adaptation, emergency management and flood risk management. He has more than 20 years of experience in applied policy analysis, including contract research for Global Affairs Canada, Health Canada, Infrastructure Canada, Natural Resources Canada, Public Safety Canada and others. Current projects 1. Effective Governance Arrangements for Climate Resilient Infrastructure Funded through a SSHRC Insight Grant, this project evaluates governance arrangements to achieve critical infrastructure (CI) resilience in a changing climate. It combines spatial analysis and comparative case studies to assess CI resilience in five sectors: health care, public safety, government services, finance and transportation. 2. Flood Risk Governance in a Changing Climate Funded through a Network Investigator Grant from the MEOPAR Network and a SSHRC Insight Grant, this project analyzes the effectiveness of Canada\u2019s flood risk governance arrangements.

Effective Governance Arrangements for Climate Resilient Infrastructure\n1. Effective Governance Arrangements for Climate Resilient Infrastructure\nFunded through a SSHRC Insight Grant, this project evaluates governance arrangements to achieve critical infrastructure (CI) resilience in a changing climate. It combines spatial analysis and comparative case studies to assess CI resilience in five sectors: health care, public safety, government services, finance and transportation.\nSSHRC Insight Grant\n2. Flood Risk Governance in a Changing Climate \n2. Flood Risk Governance in a Changing Climate \nFunded through a Network Investigator Grant from the MEOPAR Network and a SSHRC Insight Grant, this project analyzes the effectiveness of Canada\u2019s flood risk governance arrangements. Using climate change-adjusted flood maps produced by the expert hazard modelling firm JBA Risk Management, the team is engaging in Risk Dialogues with stakeholders to identify flood resilience strategies.\nMEOPAR Network\nexpert hazard modelling firm JBA Risk Management\n3. Multilevel Governance and Climate Change Adaptation Policy\n3. Multilevel Governance and Climate Change Adaptation Policy\nFunded through a SSHRC Insight Grant, this project analyzes how adaptation policies and policy-making are affected by the relationships between officials at different levels of government and by the patterns of interaction between state and societal actors.\nPublications\nPublications\nBooks\nBooks\n2013.

His current research consists of four primary projects: 1) unwritten constitutionalism, an examination of the role that constitutional conventions, unwritten principles, and the norms, practices, and customs surrounding the Constitution of Canada have for understanding constitutional law and politics; 2) legislative responses to court rulings on rights and the implications these interactions have for policy change, institutional relationships, and the meaning of the Constitution; 3) a project on free expression and hate speech in the social media age; and 4) analyses of constitutional change and the amending process. Professor Macfarlane is the author and editor of seven books. His work also appears in a range of journals, including the International Journal of Constitutional Law (I-CON), Canadian Journal of Political Science, Canadian Public Administration, International Political Science Review, McGill Law Journal, National Journal of Constitutional Law, and the Supreme Court Law Review, among others. He is currently the principal investigator of a $243,737 SSHRC Insight Grant studying the regulation of online hate speech in Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In 2022, he was awarded the Faculty of Arts Award for Excellent in Research at the University of Waterloo.

He has provided non-partisan policy advice to the Government of Canada on the Senate appointments process and the Supreme Court appointments process, to the Senate on Senate reform, and to various parliamentarians of different partisan stripes on constitutional matters. He has appeared as an expert witness before the parliamentary committees on electoral reform and on parliamentary procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic.

I use Pakistan as a case-study to address the dearth of analysis on how politics actually works in hybrid regimes. By proposing to treat hybrid regimes not as a transitional state or a defective democracy, I examine the recruitment and selection of the elite\u2014a new lens with which to examine how the fundamental coalitions of power underpinning the regime are structured. Based on this research, my book manuscript entitled Accessing Political Power and Democratization in Pakistan is under contract at Palgrave Macmillan in its book series on the Politics of South Asia. An edited volume, Pakistan\u2019s Political Parties: Surviving between Dictatorship and Democracy (Georgetown University Press, 2020), (co-edited with Dr. Niloufer Siddiqui and Dr. Sahar Shafqat) also emerged from this research agenda. It is a contemporary, and to date, the most comprehensive examination of Pakistan\u2019s party system and its growing relevance as the country makes a transition to democracy. Another passion project of mine, which is currently in progress is an introductory text on Pakistan\u2019s politics, economy and society (under contract with Routledge). I have extended my research on recruitment and selection of the political elite to examine how this has impacted the descriptive representation of women in Pakistan at all levels of government. I particularly examine the importance of how patriarchy, family structures and clientelism intersect to hinder women\u2019s entry into politics. Outputs from this research are in the form of journal articles and book chapters (see below). Apart from academic research, I have considerable policy-relevant consultancy experience, having authored monographs on democratic development, political parties and religious extremism for The Asia Foundation, Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) and Department for International Development (DFID). I have also written over 25 articles for widely-read international newspapers, magazines and blogs on politics in South Asia. In keeping with my interest in undemocratic, hybrid regimes, I have also appeared on a 6-part series on The Dictator\u2019s Playbook on PBS (released in 2018). Over the next year, I will be developing a new research agenda, which combines my interest in South Asia with diaspora politics in Canada. To this end I am working on an exploratory piece on the recalibration of Canada\u2019s foreign policy towards South Asia and how it has been influenced by its South Asian diasporic population.

I use Pakistan as a case-study to address the dearth of analysis on how politics actually works in hybrid regimes. By proposing to treat hybrid regimes not as a transitional state or a defective democracy, I examine the recruitment and selection of the elite\u2014a new lens with which to examine how the fundamental coalitions of power underpinning the regime are structured. Based on this research, my book manuscript entitled Accessing Political Power and Democratization in Pakistan is under contract at Palgrave Macmillan in its book series on the Politics of South Asia. An edited volume, Pakistan\u2019s Political Parties: Surviving between Dictatorship and Democracy (Georgetown University Press, 2020), (co-edited with Dr. Niloufer Siddiqui and Dr. Sahar Shafqat) also emerged from this research agenda. It is a contemporary, and to date, the most comprehensive examination of Pakistan\u2019s party system and its growing relevance as the country makes a transition to democracy. Another passion project of mine, which is currently in progress is an introductory text on Pakistan\u2019s politics, economy and society (under contract with Routledge). I have extended my research on recruitment and selection of the political elite to examine how this has impacted the descriptive representation of women in Pakistan at all levels of government. I particularly examine the importance of how patriarchy, family structures and clientelism intersect to hinder women\u2019s entry into politics. Outputs from this research are in the form of journal articles and book chapters (see below). Apart from academic research, I have considerable policy-relevant consultancy experience, having authored monographs on democratic development, political parties and religious extremism for The Asia Foundation, Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) and Department for International Development (DFID). I have also written over 25 articles for widely-read international newspapers, magazines and blogs on politics in South Asia. In keeping with my interest in undemocratic, hybrid regimes, I have also appeared on a 6-part series on The Dictator\u2019s Playbook on PBS (released in 2018). Over the next year, I will be developing a new research agenda, which combines my interest in South Asia with diaspora politics in Canada. To this end I am working on an exploratory piece on the recalibration of Canada\u2019s foreign policy towards South Asia and how it has been influenced by its South Asian diasporic population.

I use Pakistan as a case-study to address the dearth of analysis on how politics actually works in hybrid regimes. By proposing to treat hybrid regimes not as a transitional state or a defective democracy, I examine the recruitment and selection of the elite\u2014a new lens with which to examine how the fundamental coalitions of power underpinning the regime are structured. Based on this research, my book manuscript entitled Accessing Political Power and Democratization in Pakistan is under contract at Palgrave Macmillan in its book series on the Politics of South Asia. An edited volume, Pakistan\u2019s Political Parties: Surviving between Dictatorship and Democracy (Georgetown University Press, 2020), (co-edited with Dr. Niloufer Siddiqui and Dr. Sahar Shafqat) also emerged from this research agenda. It is a contemporary, and to date, the most comprehensive examination of Pakistan\u2019s party system and its growing relevance as the country makes a transition to democracy. Another passion project of mine, which is currently in progress is an introductory text on Pakistan\u2019s politics, economy and society (under contract with Routledge). I have extended my research on recruitment and selection of the political elite to examine how this has impacted the descriptive representation of women in Pakistan at all levels of government. I particularly examine the importance of how patriarchy, family structures and clientelism intersect to hinder women\u2019s entry into politics. Outputs from this research are in the form of journal articles and book chapters (see below). Apart from academic research, I have considerable policy-relevant consultancy experience, having authored monographs on democratic development, political parties and religious extremism for The Asia Foundation, Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) and Department for International Development (DFID). I have also written over 25 articles for widely-read international newspapers, magazines and blogs on politics in South Asia. In keeping with my interest in undemocratic, hybrid regimes, I have also appeared on a 6-part series on The Dictator\u2019s Playbook on PBS (released in 2018). Over the next year, I will be developing a new research agenda, which combines my interest in South Asia with diaspora politics in Canada. To this end I am working on an exploratory piece on the recalibration of Canada\u2019s foreign policy towards South Asia and how it has been influenced by its South Asian diasporic population.

I am also the Chair of the Council for Responsible Innovation and Technology (CRIT), created by the Office of Research to address ethics in current, emerging, and future technologies and related practices. The Games Institute was created in 2010 to study game, game-driven interactions and technologies, and, in a broader scope, any form of rich, compelling engagement with digital technologies. Its researchers \u2013 drawn from the humanities, social sciences, health sciences, computer science, and engineering \u2013 study games for entertainment, serious games, virtual reality, augmented reality, in fact any form of interactive immersive media and technology. The GI is based in a large space in East Campus 1, where its faculty members and graduate students collaborate on ideas and projects under the principles of true interdisciplinarity and of equity, diversity, and inclusivity. The Games Institute has been the focus of my research and administration since its inception. In 2012, a group of 30+ faculty members across Canada and the United States won a SSHRC Partnership Grant to create a games research network called IMMERSe (The Interactive and Multi-Modal Research Syndicate) under my directorship as principal investigator. Its $2.55M award, with cash and in-kind contributions from academic and industry partners increasing the total award to $5.8M, established a collaboration of seven universities and six industry partners to conduct research into games interpretation, player experience, and player behavior. Multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional from its inception, the network included researchers from the humanities, the social sciences, engineering, and computer science. Through the Games Institute, I have initiated numerous projects outside the SSHRC Partnership Grant, including five-year research partnerships with Scotiabank on game-driven digital experiences and Correctional Service Canada on dialogue-driven help for offenders seeking to rebuild their lives after incarceration. I have been fortunate to work with industry and community partners through the Mitacs funding body, for projects ranging from research into the design of two commercial games to research towards games that teach, through player interaction and participation, issues surrounding climate change, quantum physics, and energy conservation, among other topics. My years at the University of Waterloo have been spent helping to build the Rhetoric and Professional Writing program (now Rhetoric, Media, and Professional Communication) at the undergraduate level and the Rhetoric and Communication Design and Experimental Digital Media programs at the graduate level, while establishing a profile in the practice of professional communication and documentation. To those ends, I have published numerous how-to computer books and many feature articles, columns, and reviews in computer magazines such as PC Magazine, Smart Computing, PC Computing, PC Gamer, etc. In addition, I have consulted with a variety of technology companies on topics such as digital media creation, methods of effective interactive communication, proposal writing, copyright and patent issues, and public relations. As a games enthusiast, I have designed, developed, and produced board games of the complex simulation kind. All of this activity has found its way into my classes and my research, as has my long-time fascination with the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien. My games studies work includes the relationship of boardgames to videogames, the construction of narrative and dialogue in videogames, the function and interpretation of simulation in games, and the adaption of Tolkien\u2019s works from book and film into games.

She teaches medieval and early modern literature, general British literature and creative writing. Her research interests are in historiography, visionary poetry and embodiment. She has published articles on Middle English and Scots literature, particularly on William Langland\u2019s The Vision of Piers Plowman. She is also a poet and speculative fiction writer. Her newest work is the short fiction collection Sacraments for the Unfit (Aqueduct, 2023), a series of weird tales written during the pandemic, all of which concern the deep transformations that can happen while staying in place: an out-0f-work angel adjusts to his new situation, a medievalist going blind gets into a strange relationship with the ghost of the codicologist M. R. James, the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein begins to send up symbolic objects out of his grave in a last-ditch effort to communicate. Her previous novella All the Horses of Iceland, a far-traveller saga set along the Volga trade route in the ninth century about an Icelander bringing horses home from Mongolia, was named one of the top ten fantasy books of 2022 by The New York Times. In 2020, she published three books: the weird short fiction collection Disease, a conspectus of imaginary diseases in which people live with conditions such as Privacy or Involuntary Compassion, suffer various semiotic allergies, or have their fragility manifested by turning into glass; the poetry collection Check, an academic satire; and the novella The Fourth Island, set on a fictional fourth Aran island off the coast of Ireland on which people from diverse historical periods end up after passing through the state of despair. Her most recent full-length novel was with Aqueduct Press in 2019, The Little Animals, an alternate history of science starring Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek, the 17th-century Dutch microscopist, and a feral child based on the Goose Girl from the Brothers\u2019 Grimm. Research for this book involved spending five months in the Netherlands, hosted by the Centre for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology at the University of Utrecht, funded by the Canada Council. It earned a Special Citation at the 2020 Philip K Dick Awards. Her second collection of poems from McGill-Queen\u2019s, The Art of Dying, was a finalist for the 2018 Griffin Prize for Excellence in Poetry, while her first, the sonnet collection Trio, was shortlisted for the League of Canadian Poets\u2019 Pat Lowther Award in 2016. Her other works of fiction with Aqueduct Press include the two-novella collection Two Travelers, the linked short story collection NoFood, and the novel The Stone Boatmen, shortlisted for the Crawford Award for best debut novel from the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts in 2015. Her creative work has appeared in Year\u2019s Best Canadian Poetry in English, Year\u2019s Best Weird Fiction, The New Quarterly, Grain, Strange Horizons, On Spec, The Malahat Review and The Canadian Literary Review. In 2021, she was one of four women poets chosen to represent Canada in the AR poetry installation Fiery Sparks of Light at the Frankfurt Book Fair, along with Canisia Lubrin, Nicole Brossard and Margaret Atwood.

She teaches medieval and early modern literature, general British literature and creative writing. Her research interests are in historiography, visionary poetry and embodiment. She has published articles on Middle English and Scots literature, particularly on William Langland\u2019s The Vision of Piers Plowman. She is also a poet and speculative fiction writer. Her newest work is the short fiction collection Sacraments for the Unfit (Aqueduct, 2023), a series of weird tales written during the pandemic, all of which concern the deep transformations that can happen while staying in place: an out-0f-work angel adjusts to his new situation, a medievalist going blind gets into a strange relationship with the ghost of the codicologist M. R. James, the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein begins to send up symbolic objects out of his grave in a last-ditch effort to communicate. Her previous novella All the Horses of Iceland, a far-traveller saga set along the Volga trade route in the ninth century about an Icelander bringing horses home from Mongolia, was named one of the top ten fantasy books of 2022 by The New York Times. In 2020, she published three books: the weird short fiction collection Disease, a conspectus of imaginary diseases in which people live with conditions such as Privacy or Involuntary Compassion, suffer various semiotic allergies, or have their fragility manifested by turning into glass; the poetry collection Check, an academic satire; and the novella The Fourth Island, set on a fictional fourth Aran island off the coast of Ireland on which people from diverse historical periods end up after passing through the state of despair. Her most recent full-length novel was with Aqueduct Press in 2019, The Little Animals, an alternate history of science starring Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek, the 17th-century Dutch microscopist, and a feral child based on the Goose Girl from the Brothers\u2019 Grimm. Research for this book involved spending five months in the Netherlands, hosted by the Centre for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology at the University of Utrecht, funded by the Canada Council. It earned a Special Citation at the 2020 Philip K Dick Awards. Her second collection of poems from McGill-Queen\u2019s, The Art of Dying, was a finalist for the 2018 Griffin Prize for Excellence in Poetry, while her first, the sonnet collection Trio, was shortlisted for the League of Canadian Poets\u2019 Pat Lowther Award in 2016. Her other works of fiction with Aqueduct Press include the two-novella collection Two Travelers, the linked short story collection NoFood, and the novel The Stone Boatmen, shortlisted for the Crawford Award for best debut novel from the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts in 2015. Her creative work has appeared in Year\u2019s Best Canadian Poetry in English, Year\u2019s Best Weird Fiction, The New Quarterly, Grain, Strange Horizons, On Spec, The Malahat Review and The Canadian Literary Review.

My co-edited (with Candida Rifkind) book Canadian Graphic: Picturing Life Narratives, was published by Wilfrid Laurier University Press in 2016.

Since my MA (Communication: Rhetoric and Culture, CU Boulder) and my PhD (Communication and Culture, York University), I\u2019ve been interested in the ways that people engage in rhetorical resistance by speaking back to systems in power, and the ways that these rhetorics offer critical sources of data that form the basis of community-centred change. My MA explored mediations of activist graffiti and the politics of their aesthetics on social media, while my doctoral work was dedicated to developing a theoretical framework (what I called intersectional entanglements) for grappling with the complexities of online phenomena, like digital social movements, through the example of #MeToo. These experiences directly inform my overarching research goals, which are to: (1) highlight equitable alternatives to normative media practices; (2) amplify the work of racialized, queer, disabled, and other equity-deserving groups; and (3) embrace multiple forms of expertise, knowledge, and lived experience. To work towards these research goals, I work at the intersections of digital culture, rhetoric, and feminist media studies. Across these fields, I leverage queer and intersectional feminist perspectives to examine the rhetorics, politics, and design of technologies and digital artifacts, and I ask questions about power at individual, community, and structural levels. My commitment to academia is also a commitment to political mobilizing and to scholarly activism\u2014a constant feminist reminder that the personal (as well as community and structural) is political. Because of this, my interdisciplinary work inevitably draws on my own experience as a mixed-race queer activist-scholar. Alongside my colleague and co-conspirator, Dr. Shana MacDonald, I am the Co-Director of the Feminist Think Tank, a research-creation collective that advances research on feminist media, art, and design, out of which we co-run the digital archive Feminists Do Media (Instagram: @aesthetic.resistance).

First, I\u2019m wrapping up a companion anthology to my recent co-edited collection (Networked Feminisms, Lexington) titled Stories of Feminist Protest and Resistance: Digital Performative Assemblies. This collection focuses on how feminists resist through creating the kinds of spaces that center people who have been marginalized, without pathologizing their everyday discrimination, so that stories that have been silenced can be amplified, gain momentum, and flourish. Second, I\u2019m working on a manuscript that outlines \u201cintersectional entanglements,\u201d the theoretical framework I developed during my doctoral work. Intersectional entanglements offer an approach to analyzing the pressing social movements of our time, like #MeToo, turning us towards the complex and interrelated technocultural, sociopolitical, material, and power interactions of digitally mediated spaces.

This book is a formalization of the method of following our hunches and our curiosities\u2013\u2013of dwelling, and collecting, and collaborating, and remediating, and of poking and prodding at the status quo\u2013\u2013to chart major feminist happenings from 2012-2022.

Since my MA (Communication: Rhetoric and Culture, CU Boulder) and my PhD (Communication and Culture, York University), I\u2019ve been interested in the ways that people engage in rhetorical resistance by speaking back to systems in power, and the ways that these rhetorics offer critical sources of data that form the basis of community-centred change. My MA explored mediations of activist graffiti and the politics of their aesthetics on social media, while my doctoral work was dedicated to developing a theoretical framework (what I called intersectional entanglements) for grappling with the complexities of online phenomena, like digital social movements, through the example of #MeToo. These experiences directly inform my overarching research goals, which are to: (1) highlight equitable alternatives to normative media practices; (2) amplify the work of racialized, queer, disabled, and other equity-deserving groups; and (3) embrace multiple forms of expertise, knowledge, and lived experience. To work towards these research goals, I work at the intersections of digital culture, rhetoric, and feminist media studies. Across these fields, I leverage queer and intersectional feminist perspectives to examine the rhetorics, politics, and design of technologies and digital artifacts, and I ask questions about power at individual, community, and structural levels. My commitment to academia is also a commitment to political mobilizing and to scholarly activism\u2014a constant feminist reminder that the personal (as well as community and structural) is political. Because of this, my interdisciplinary work inevitably draws on my own experience as a mixed-race queer activist-scholar.

First, I\u2019m wrapping up a companion anthology to my recent co-edited collection (Networked Feminisms, Lexington) titled Stories of Feminist Protest and Resistance: Digital Performative Assemblies. This collection focuses on how feminists resist through creating the kinds of spaces that center people who have been marginalized, without pathologizing their everyday discrimination, so that stories that have been silenced can be amplified, gain momentum, and flourish. Second, I\u2019m working on a manuscript that outlines \u201cintersectional entanglements,\u201d the theoretical framework I developed during my doctoral work. Intersectional entanglements offer an approach to analyzing the pressing social movements of our time, like #MeToo, turning us towards the complex and interrelated technocultural, sociopolitical, material, and power interactions of digitally mediated spaces. Last, alongside Dr. MacDonald, I\u2019m co-writing a monograph on Utopic Refusals: Aesthetic Resistance and Justice Through Intersectional Feminist Media. This book is a formalization of the method of following our hunches and our curiosities\u2013\u2013of dwelling, and collecting, and collaborating, and remediating, and of poking and prodding at the status quo\u2013\u2013to chart major feminist happenings from 2012-2022. We follow the trail of feminist uses of aesthetic media resistance and analyze them for the ways they foster kinships to explore, name, and respond to community.\nNetworked Feminisms, \nStories of Feminist Protest and Resistance: Digital Performative Assemblies.\nUtopic Refusals: Aesthetic Resistance and Justice Through Intersectional Feminist Media. \nAreas of Graduate Supervision \nAreas of Graduate Supervision \nFeminist media studies Feminist and queer affect studies Feminist new materialisms and posthumanisms Digital activisms and networked social movements Social media cultures Rhetorics of design Design equity, data feminism, and data justice Critical approaches to technology \nFeminist media studies \nFeminist and queer affect studies\nFeminist new materialisms and posthumanisms\nDigital activisms and networked social movements\nSocial media cultures\nRhetorics of design\nDesign equity, data feminism, and data justice\nCritical approaches to technology\nAffiliation: University of Waterloo\nAffiliation: \nUniversity of Waterloo\nUniversity of Waterloo\n\n\n"}, {"profile": "https://experts.uwaterloo.ca/david-williams", "name": "David Williams", "position": "Associate Professor  Faculty of Arts Department of English Language and Literature ", "email": "david.williams@uwaterloo.ca", "expertise": ["Contemporary poetry", "Digital humanities", "Etymology", "Poetry", "Society", "World fantasy", "World history"], "bio": " ProfessorDPhil, OxfordMPhil, St AndrewsBA, Harvard Extension: 28287Email: david.williams@uwaterloo.ca Website Biography I studied English-language poetry in the United States, Scotland, and England, before coming home to Canada in 2010 to teach modern and contemporary British and Irish literature at UW and St Jerome\u2019s.

I am a multi-disciplinary artist, scholar, and teacher, I integrate these multiple areas into my published work and instruction, such as communication, composition and rhetoric, education, American literature, and theatre. I am perhaps best known for advancing my educational and sociolinguistic concept \u201ccode-meshing,\u201d which means allowing minoritized language users to blend their cultural and heritage languages within academic, professional and public writing and speaking.

And yet, the BRICS - encompassing Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - has emerged as a challenge to the international status quo. But what is its capacity as a transformative force? And can it provide a significant counter-narrative to the Western dominated global order? In this Very Short Introduction Andrew Cooper explores the emergence of the BRICS as a concept. Drawing on historical precedent, Cooper provides a contemporary analysis of the BRICS' practice and influence as as a forum and a lobby group in advancing a distinctive but amorphous agenda amongst global politics.

And yet, the BRICS - encompassing Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - has emerged as a challenge to the international status quo. But what is its capacity as a transformative force? And can it provide a significant counter-narrative to the Western dominated global order? In this Very Short Introduction Andrew Cooper explores the emergence of the BRICS as a concept. Drawing on historical precedent, Cooper provides a contemporary analysis of the BRICS' practice and influence as as a forum and a lobby group in advancing a distinctive but amorphous agenda amongst global politics.\n\n\nVery Short Introduction\nAdditional links & information\nAdditional links & information\nCooper Andrew. \u2018A critical evaluation of rationalist IR in the analysis of informal institutions\u2019.

Additional links and information Experiential Research Dr. Jasmin Habib always been keen to demystify the scholarly research and writing process for our students. In her role as Editor in Chief and Editor of English Manuscripts for Anthropologica (the journal of the Canadian Anthropology Society), she has introduced students to the practices and responsibilities associated with editing an academic journal, from a paper\u2019s submission, through review, to its production. In SSHRC funded projects, including \u201cA Socio-Cultural Mapping of the Canadian Arab Community: Migration, Settlement and Integration\u201d, Jasmin has shared everything from grant proposal-writing strategies, to careful completion of the research ethics review, as well as engaging students in the project itself. Research assistance involved library and media searches for relevant sources; annotating selected sources for scholars, policy makers and the wider community; finding ways to build on a students\u2019 own research interests in meaningful ways; and discussing opportunities for and working towards collaboration and co-authorship. Given Jasmin\u2019s research is ethnographic and draws on postcolonial and postmodern critique, primarily of empire and its violent logics, research topics ranged from the theoretical to the empirical and included, for example, the experiences of war- affected refugees and transnational relationships among and between displaced communities; understanding the links between oil politics, regimes of terror and Canada\u2019s interventionist as well as (though less evident) peacebuilding policies abroad, especially in the Middle East; and theories and practices of frontline diplomacy. Allowing students to draw on their own experiences and insights \u2013 as well as their engagement in their own and overseas communities -- has enriched Jasmin\u2019s research. Their contributions have been invaluable. \"How do you know that you have met a Professor who not only has a magic way with words, but also has the key to unlock hidden pieces of knowledge you may already have?

Additional links and information Experiential Research Dr. Jasmin Habib always been keen to demystify the scholarly research and writing process for our students. In her role as Editor in Chief and Editor of English Manuscripts for Anthropologica (the journal of the Canadian Anthropology Society), she has introduced students to the practices and responsibilities associated with editing an academic journal, from a paper\u2019s submission, through review, to its production. In SSHRC funded projects, including \u201cA Socio-Cultural Mapping of the Canadian Arab Community: Migration, Settlement and Integration\u201d, Jasmin has shared everything from grant proposal-writing strategies, to careful completion of the research ethics review, as well as engaging students in the project itself. Research assistance involved library and media searches for relevant sources; annotating selected sources for scholars, policy makers and the wider community; finding ways to build on a students\u2019 own research interests in meaningful ways; and discussing opportunities for and working towards collaboration and co-authorship. Given Jasmin\u2019s research is ethnographic and draws on postcolonial and postmodern critique, primarily of empire and its violent logics, research topics ranged from the theoretical to the empirical and included, for example, the experiences of war- affected refugees and transnational relationships among and between displaced communities; understanding the links between oil politics, regimes of terror and Canada\u2019s interventionist as well as (though less evident) peacebuilding policies abroad, especially in the Middle East; and theories and practices of frontline diplomacy. Allowing students to draw on their own experiences and insights \u2013 as well as their engagement in their own and overseas communities -- has enriched Jasmin\u2019s research. Their contributions have been invaluable. \"How do you know that you have met a Professor who not only has a magic way with words, but also has the key to unlock hidden pieces of knowledge you may already have? You go in for a short interview, and come out hours later having learned so much not only about the professor, but also about yourself! Dr. Jasmin Habib is the embodiment of such a thought-provoking and insightful instructor.

In her role as Editor in Chief and Editor of English Manuscripts for Anthropologica (the journal of the Canadian Anthropology Society), she has introduced students to the practices and responsibilities associated with editing an academic journal, from a paper\u2019s submission, through review, to its production. In SSHRC funded projects, including \u201cA Socio-Cultural Mapping of the Canadian Arab Community: Migration, Settlement and Integration\u201d, Jasmin has shared everything from grant proposal-writing strategies, to careful completion of the research ethics review, as well as engaging students in the project itself. Research assistance involved library and media searches for relevant sources; annotating selected sources for scholars, policy makers and the wider community; finding ways to build on a students\u2019 own research interests in meaningful ways; and discussing opportunities for and working towards collaboration and co-authorship. Given Jasmin\u2019s research is ethnographic and draws on postcolonial and postmodern critique, primarily of empire and its violent logics, research topics ranged from the theoretical to the empirical and included, for example, the experiences of war- affected refugees and transnational relationships among and between displaced communities; understanding the links between oil politics, regimes of terror and Canada\u2019s interventionist as well as (though less evident) peacebuilding policies abroad, especially in the Middle East; and theories and practices of frontline diplomacy. Allowing students to draw on their own experiences and insights \u2013 as well as their engagement in their own and overseas communities -- has enriched Jasmin\u2019s research. Their contributions have been invaluable.\nAnthropologica\n\"How do you know that you have met a Professor who not only has a magic way with words, but also has the key to unlock hidden pieces of knowledge you may already have?

I am the PI on the SSHRC Insight Grant-funded project \"How Mid-Level Theoretical Frameworks Are Used to Develop New Theories in Physics.\" Mid-level frameworks such as analytical mechanics or the spontaneous symmetry breaking paradigm are neither entirely abstract (e.g., pure mathematics) nor entirely concrete (e.g., a model for a particular type of system, such as a pulley or the Higgs boson). The ultimate goals of this project are to glean methodological lessons about how to successfully employ mid-level frameworks and to apply these methodological lessons to current programs for formulating new theories of quantum gravity and particle physics.

My research examines individual biases that cause people to perceive illusory patterns of societal decline, intergroup biases that polarize perceptions of progress towards racial and gender equality, and the phenomenological cues that influence the recognition of personal aging. I am also interested in social movement dynamics, the development of moral panics, and the relative success of competing ideologies. The theme of change links my interests in social judgment, autobiographical memory processes, intergroup conflict, political psychology, and life-course transitions. \n Selected publications\n Eibach, R.

I am particularly interested in how these change as people age. I evaluate the ability of young adults and seniors to carry out a memory task under conditions in which there is another on-going task competing for their attention. I also use neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging: fMRI) to identify the brain regions and networks mediating memory processing; these are used to determine how the strategy and brain regions contributing to memory change as we age.

I am interested in knowing how we encode new information, how it is organized and represented in the brain, and how we reactivate the information during retrieval. I am particularly interested in how these change as people age. I evaluate the ability of young adults and seniors to carry out a memory task under conditions in which there is another on-going task competing for their attention. I also use neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging: fMRI) to identify the brain regions and networks mediating memory processing; these are used to determine how the strategy and brain regions contributing to memory change as we age. A related research interest lies in understanding how different types of information (words, numbers, symbols, spatial layouts) are represented and organized in the brain, through the use of behavioural paradigms and fMRI. My other line of research examines the relationship between neuropsychological and neuroimaging methods of evaluation of language localization.

I am interested in knowing how we encode new information, how it is organized and represented in the brain, and how we reactivate the information during retrieval. I am particularly interested in how these change as people age. I evaluate the ability of young adults and seniors to carry out a memory task under conditions in which there is another on-going task competing for their attention. I also use neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging: fMRI) to identify the brain regions and networks mediating memory processing; these are used to determine how the strategy and brain regions contributing to memory change as we age. A related research interest lies in understanding how different types of information (words, numbers, symbols, spatial layouts) are represented and organized in the brain, through the use of behavioural paradigms and fMRI. My other line of research examines the relationship between neuropsychological and neuroimaging methods of evaluation of language localization.

I am available for limited additional supervision of undergraduate and graduate students with projects that align with my current research projects and grants. My interdisciplinary research tackles vital questions about education and justice. My current focus is on oral history as a path for the redress of historical harms through education (e.g., schools and museums). I am the author and co-editor of four books, including Democracy\u2019s Angels: The Work of Women Teachers and the award-winning Oral History, Education, and Justice. I am a regular media commentator on education issues, promoting nuanced understandings of policies and practices related to teaching and learning for an equitable society.

(218 pages) Current research projects Digital Oral History for Reconciliation: The Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children History Education Initiative (DOHR) DOHR is a community-driven project, supported by SSHRC, that has created a history curriculum unit about the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children. The curriculum includes a virtual reality experience centered on the oral histories of former residents of the Home. The project takes a restorative approach to the redress of historical harms in education. The curriculum was featured on CBC\u2019s The National. Currently, the research team is working with the Nova Scotia Black Cultural Centre to create an exhibit around DOHR, including a school resource kit. The team has also expanded, supported by a New Frontiers grant, to explore the use of haptics for storytelling in the museum exhibit. Thinking Historically for Canada\u2019s Future This national project, supported by a SSHRC partnership grant, is studying the state of history education in Canada. The team is identifying and developing evidenced-based practices for engaged history teaching and learning. The project will provide recommendations for reforms and innovations in history education. Currently, the research team is engaged in a comprehensive analysis of history curricula and textbooks/resources across Canada. In addition, I am co-editing with colleagues a collection on Women, Gender, and History Education in Canada.

The team has also expanded, supported by a New Frontiers grant, to explore the use of haptics for storytelling in the museum exhibit. Thinking Historically for Canada\u2019s Future This national project, supported by a SSHRC partnership grant, is studying the state of history education in Canada. The team is identifying and developing evidenced-based practices for engaged history teaching and learning. The project will provide recommendations for reforms and innovations in history education. Currently, the research team is engaged in a comprehensive analysis of history curricula and textbooks/resources across Canada.

This has evolved from a study conducted for the Canadian Museum of Civilization which has resulted in a web-based project called \"Making Canadian Medicare-Healthcare in Canada, 1914-2007.\" This site contains 300 web pages of historical information, photos, and vingettes explaining key people, events and financial and political terms. Available in both French and English, the site is designed for the public and for students and teachers. It received an honourable mention for the inaugural Public History Prize competition held by the Canadian Historical Association in 2011.\nIn addition, I am collaborating with Professor Laurence Monnais of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al on a longitudinal study of the contested adoption of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in Ontario and Quebec from its introduction in 1963 to the present. We are working with public health agencies in both our provinces to determine which historical factors have influenced public support, opposition and ambivalence to immunization campaigns and the extent to which such factors are still important in our wired world.\nAs we complete our historical monograph on the MMR vaccine in Canada, Professor Monnais and I will begin a new project\u2013\u2013 an SSHRC-funded international team investigation of the global history of measles as a disease and object of national and international control and prevention policies since 1945.\nProfessional affiliations\nMember, Forum on Public Policy editorial board, 2009-present \nMember, Forum on Public Policy editorial board, 2009-present\nForum on Public Policy\nAffiliation: University of Waterloo\nAffiliation: \nUniversity of Waterloo\nUniversity of Waterloo\nContact information: Heather MacDougall\nContact information: \nHeather MacDougall\nHeather MacDougall\nHeather MacDougall\n\n\n"}, {"profile": "https://experts.uwaterloo.ca/ian-milligan", "name": "Ian Milligan", "position": "Associate Professor Principal investigator, Web Archives for Historical Research group  Faculty of Arts Department of History ", "email": "i2milligan@uwaterloo.ca", "expertise": ["Accessibility of data", "Big Data", "Digital methods", "Digital repositories", "History of the Internet", "History of the world wide web", "How historians work"], "bio": " Associate Vice-President, Research Oversight and Analysis; Professor Ian Milligan is Associate Vice-President, Research Oversight and Analysis in the University of Waterloo's Office of Research.

Firstly, how and why did the East India Company, a trading corporation, in the century after 1750 gain political and economic control of much of India, yet almost lose it between 1857 and 1858 in a violent uprising. Secondly, how do we account for the discrepancy between a dominant Victorian narrative which lingers to this day that located British imperialism within a storyline favouring liberal capitalism, individualism, and modernity, yet relied so heavily on coercion and illiberal attitudes. In seeking answers to these questions, my work has focused largely on how the structures, cultures, and ideologies of British imperialism were profoundly experienced by the prejudices and preoccupations of its military institutions and personnel. I am also interested in the historiography of imperialism, and in particular the degree to which our contemporary world continues to be shaped \u2013 consciously and unconsciously \u2013 by the history, memory, and mythologies of imperial rule.

Longer-term projects include an analysis of order and disorder in the armies of the East India Company using courts martial records to examine how discipline in a multi-ethnic army functioned in practice as well as in theory; and also a study of how the histories of the siege of Lucknow (1857-58) have been written and rewritten over the past century and a half and why it has been deemed necessary to shift the narratives.

Firstly, how and why did the East India Company, a trading corporation, in the century after 1750 gain political and economic control of much of India, yet almost lose it between 1857 and 1858 in a violent uprising. Secondly, how do we account for the discrepancy between a dominant Victorian narrative which lingers to this day that located British imperialism within a storyline favouring liberal capitalism, individualism, and modernity, yet relied so heavily on coercion and illiberal attitudes. In seeking answers to these questions, my work has focused largely on how the structures, cultures, and ideologies of British imperialism were profoundly experienced by the prejudices and preoccupations of its military institutions and personnel. I am also interested in the historiography of imperialism, and in particular the degree to which our contemporary world continues to be shaped \u2013 consciously and unconsciously \u2013 by the history, memory, and mythologies of imperial rule.

I like its traditional element: the profession of knowledge in a public setting. I like its service role: assisting students to reach whatever goals first brought them to the University. I want students to learn to value History for its power to shape their sense of place, identity, and citizenship. But I know I have done my job well when they learn to read with more comprehension, write more fluently and persuasively, improve their skills in critical thinking, or when they can discuss competing interpretations with mutual respect.

After moving to Canada, I found myself short of earthquakes and had to change my profession. I chose history; that\u2019s what I have been doing ever since. \n\nI have worked on pro- and anti-Soviet resistance during World War II, Soviet counterinsurgency, Soviet and Romanian military history, Soviet deportations and Russian war memory.\nEducation\nB.Sc.

Her research and teaching combine a variety of fields, including ethnomusicology, anthropology, music analysis, performance, ritual studies, peace and conflict studies, psychology, and health studies. As performer and general director of the College\u2019s two gamelan ensembles, she shares her passion for Balinese music with a wide audience through concerts, workshops, worship services, and open access recordings. Sum has disseminated her research internationally through publications in scholarly journals including Ethnomusicology, speaking invitations, and presentations at conferences such as the Society for Ethnomusicology, Analytical Approaches to World Music, and British Forum for Ethnomusicology. In 2014 she received the Jaap Kunst Prize in recognition for an article published in African Music, which investigates the interactive network between music, dance, and ritual experience. Recent work includes an experimental research project that explores rhythm and repetition in community healing rituals from a psychological and cross-cultural perspective. Drawing on ethnographic research in Morocco, her current book project investigates music and performance of a Black diaspora community called Gnawa. Her research has been supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the UWaterloo/SSHRC Seed Grant. Sum is a member of the Society for Ethnomusicology, Canadian Society for Traditional Music, and British Forum for Ethnomusicology, and has served on the editorial board of MUSICultures, and as program committee co-chair for the Analytical Approaches to World Music 2020/21 Conference.

Her research and teaching combine a variety of fields, including ethnomusicology, anthropology, music analysis, performance, ritual studies, peace and conflict studies, psychology, and health studies. As performer and general director of the College\u2019s two gamelan ensembles, she shares her passion for Balinese music with a wide audience through concerts, workshops, worship services, and open access recordings. Sum has disseminated her research internationally through publications in scholarly journals including Ethnomusicology, speaking invitations, and presentations at conferences such as the Society for Ethnomusicology, Analytical Approaches to World Music, and British Forum for Ethnomusicology. In 2014 she received the Jaap Kunst Prize in recognition for an article published in African Music, which investigates the interactive network between music, dance, and ritual experience. Recent work includes an experimental research project that explores rhythm and repetition in community healing rituals from a psychological and cross-cultural perspective. Drawing on ethnographic research in Morocco, her current book project investigates music and performance of a Black diaspora community called Gnawa. Her research has been supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the UWaterloo/SSHRC Seed Grant.

Karen often finds inspiration from puzzles, stories and her M\u00e9tis and mixed European heritage. She has deep roots in the Red River Settlement (what is now known as Manitoba, Canada) and feels a strong connection to the M\u00e9tis, Scottish, Swedish and Finnish cultures. This mix of cultural connections sometimes creates conflicts and new perspectives which she finds both interesting and challenging. Her music reflects this cultural mix through the exploration of the sounds and stories of the Canadian prairies.

Karen often finds inspiration from puzzles, stories and her M\u00e9tis and mixed European heritage. She has deep roots in the Red River Settlement (what is now known as Manitoba, Canada) and feels a strong connection to the M\u00e9tis, Scottish, Swedish and Finnish cultures. This mix of cultural connections sometimes creates conflicts and new perspectives which she finds both interesting and challenging. Her music reflects this cultural mix through the exploration of the sounds and stories of the Canadian prairies. She often collaborates with her M\u00e9tis mother, Joyce Clouston, who is a writer, an Indigenous Cultural Carrier, and social worker.

Karen often finds inspiration from puzzles, stories and her M\u00e9tis and mixed European heritage. She has deep roots in the Red River Settlement (what is now known as Manitoba, Canada) and feels a strong connection to the M\u00e9tis, Scottish, Swedish and Finnish cultures. This mix of cultural connections sometimes creates conflicts and new perspectives which she finds both interesting and challenging. Her music reflects this cultural mix through the exploration of the sounds and stories of the Canadian prairies. She often collaborates with her M\u00e9tis mother, Joyce Clouston, who is a writer, an Indigenous Cultural Carrier, and social worker. Together they have completed numerous works that explore family stories and the intersections of Indigenous -Settler relations and philosophies. Pieces they have completed include: Mama\u2019s Painting: Louis Riel\u2019s Dream for piano quartet (2015), I Wasn\u2019t Meant for This for viola d\u2019amore and percussion (2019), English Horn Concerto: In Memory of Beverly Clouston (2019) \u2026our inner lives were entwined\u2026embroidered with the same pattern for solo piano (2021) and The Place Where the Creator Rests (2022) for piano trio and spoken voices. In demand as a composer, Karen enjoys the challenge of finding a balance between teaching, composing, performing, and keeping up with her favourite science fiction and fantasy series. Karen\u2019s compositions have been commissioned and premiered by the Montreal Metropolitan Orchestra, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, the Regina Symphony Orchestra, Park Sounds, Andromeda Trio, the Indigo Trio, and many other ensembles and solo artists.

Karen often finds inspiration from puzzles, stories and her M\u00e9tis and mixed European heritage. She has deep roots in the Red River Settlement (what is now known as Manitoba, Canada) and feels a strong connection to the M\u00e9tis, Scottish, Swedish and Finnish cultures. This mix of cultural connections sometimes creates conflicts and new perspectives which she finds both interesting and challenging. Her music reflects this cultural mix through the exploration of the sounds and stories of the Canadian prairies. She often collaborates with her M\u00e9tis mother, Joyce Clouston, who is a writer, an Indigenous Cultural Carrier, and social worker. Together they have completed numerous works that explore family stories and the intersections of Indigenous -Settler relations and philosophies. Pieces they have completed include: Mama\u2019s Painting: Louis Riel\u2019s Dream for piano quartet (2015), I Wasn\u2019t Meant for This for viola d\u2019amore and percussion (2019), English Horn Concerto: In Memory of Beverly Clouston (2019) \u2026our inner lives were entwined\u2026embroidered with the same pattern for solo piano (2021) and The Place Where the Creator Rests (2022) for piano trio and spoken voices.

Karen often finds inspiration from puzzles, stories and her M\u00e9tis and mixed European heritage. She has deep roots in the Red River Settlement (what is now known as Manitoba, Canada) and feels a strong connection to the M\u00e9tis, Scottish, Swedish and Finnish cultures. This mix of cultural connections sometimes creates conflicts and new perspectives which she finds both interesting and challenging. Her music reflects this cultural mix through the exploration of the sounds and stories of the Canadian prairies. \nKaren Sunabacka\nKaren Sunabacka\n is an Associate Professor of Music at Conrad Grebel University College, where she teaches Music Theory and composition. \n\nShe often collaborates with her M\u00e9tis mother, Joyce Clouston, who is a writer, an Indigenous Cultural Carrier, and social worker.

Background I am an Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Waterloo and Fellow at the Balsillie School of International Affairs. I am currently working on research supported by a SSHRC Insight Development Grant and UW/SSHRC Explore Seed Grant for archival research (2020-24) on joint-stock royal charter companies, and a SSHRC Insight Grant (2021-24) on public enterprise solutions for post-pandemic recoveries. My book Capitalist Political Economy (2020) recently won the 2022 Rik Davidson/Studies in Political Economy Book Prize In 2020, I received an Arts Award for Excellence in Research. In 2017, I received an Outstanding Performance Award. I am a board member of the journal Studies in Political Economy, co-editor of Alternate Routes: a journal of critical social research, and an International Corresponding Editor for Urban Studies. I am a member of the Waterloo Political Economy Group (WatPEG). Research My research interests include: My research and publications centre on the political economy of privatization, financialization, and fiscal austerity. I have published articles in journals such as Economic Geography, Environment and Planning A, Studies in Political Economy, Urban Studies, and Health Sociology Review. My books are: Varieties of Austerity (with Stephen McBride and Bryan Evans, 2021), Capitalist Political Economy: Thinkers and Theories (2020, Routledge), Canadian Political Economy (editor, 2020, University of Toronto Press), About Canada: Public-Private Partnerships (2016, Fernwood Publishing), Purchase for Profit: public-private partnerships and Canada's public health care system (2015, University of Toronto Press), and Private Affluence, Public Austerity: economic crisis and democratic malaise in Canada (with Stephen McBride, 2011, Fernwood Publishing). Varieties of Austerity Austerity is not always one-size-fits-all; it can be a flexible, class-based strategy taking several forms depending on the political-economic forces and institutional characteristics present. This important book identifies continuity and variety in crisis-driven austerity restructuring across Canada, Denmark, Ireland and Spain. In their analysis, the authors focus on several components of austerity, including fiscal and monetary policy, budget narratives, public sector reform, labor market flexibilization, and resistance. In so doing, they uncover how austerity can be categorized into different dynamic types, and expose the economic, social, and political implications of the varieties of austerity. Capitalist Political Economy: Thinkers and Theorie A key text, Capitalist Political Economy: Thinkers and Theories analyses the field-forming theoretical contributions to political economy that have defined, debated, critiqued, and defended capitalism for more than three centuries. Political economy recognizes and celebrates the many and varied interconnections between politics and economics in society, together with the economic implications of public policy and the political impact of market and property relations. As such, political economy is both an approach to understanding capitalism and a reflection of the forms and features of capitalism at particular moments. Grounded in primary and secondary literature including theorists\u2019 original writings and leading literary biographies, this text explores principal themes in the development of capitalism and political economic thought. It relates these to markets, property, profits, labour, investment, innovation, the state, growth and crises, gender, the ecological limits of capital accumulation, and rival economic practices. The book contextualizes the legacy of foundational political economists by exploring their life and times and putting them in conversation with other highly influential theorists. Equally, it also considers more contemporary views. This book serves as an indispensable source for academic communities who are interested in the long arc of capitalist development, theories, and theorists. Canadian Political EconomyIn Canadian Political Economy, experts from a number of disciplinary backgrounds come together to explore Canada\u2019s empirical political economy and the field's contributions to theory and debate. Considering both historical and contemporary approaches to CPE, the contributors pay particular attention to key actors and institutions, as well as developments in Canadian political-economic policies and practices, explored through themes of changes, crises, and conflicts in CPE. Offering up-to-date interpretations, analyses, and descriptions, Canadian Political Economy is accessibly written and suitable for students and scholars. Through 17 chapters, the book\u2019s topics include theory, history, inequality, work, free trade and fair trade, co-operatives, banking and finance, the environment, indigeneity, and the gendered politics of political economy. Linking longstanding debates with current developments, this volume represents both a state-of-the-discipline and a state-of-the-art contribution to scholarship. Purchase for Profit: Public-Private Partnerships and Canada's Public Health-Care System Canadian provinces have increasingly begun turning to the private sector to finance and construct large-scale infrastructure projects. From a critical public policy perspective, the danger of these public-private partnerships (P3s) is that they are more than just new ways to deliver public infrastructure. They are neoliberal projects that privatize and corporatize the basis of public services.\u200bAnalyzing four Canadian P3 hospital projects, Heather Whiteside argues that P3s not only fail to fulfill the promises made by their proponents but also compromise public control of health policy, outcomes, and future plans. Yet, despite these disadvantages, the use of P3s is being normalized and expanded in BC and Ontario through capital planning frameworks and special government agencies that support and encourage P3 projects. Based on extensive interviews with academic experts, union representatives, provincial government decision-makers, and private sector partners, Purchase for Profit will be important for those studying public policy in any of the areas in which P3s are now being adopted.

I am a member of the Waterloo Political Economy Group (WatPEG). Research My research interests include: My research and publications centre on the political economy of privatization, financialization, and fiscal austerity. I have published articles in journals such as Economic Geography, Environment and Planning A, Studies in Political Economy, Urban Studies, and Health Sociology Review. My books are: Varieties of Austerity (with Stephen McBride and Bryan Evans, 2021), Capitalist Political Economy: Thinkers and Theories (2020, Routledge), Canadian Political Economy (editor, 2020, University of Toronto Press), About Canada: Public-Private Partnerships (2016, Fernwood Publishing), Purchase for Profit: public-private partnerships and Canada's public health care system (2015, University of Toronto Press), and Private Affluence, Public Austerity: economic crisis and democratic malaise in Canada (with Stephen McBride, 2011, Fernwood Publishing). Varieties of Austerity Austerity is not always one-size-fits-all; it can be a flexible, class-based strategy taking several forms depending on the political-economic forces and institutional characteristics present. This important book identifies continuity and variety in crisis-driven austerity restructuring across Canada, Denmark, Ireland and Spain. In their analysis, the authors focus on several components of austerity, including fiscal and monetary policy, budget narratives, public sector reform, labor market flexibilization, and resistance. In so doing, they uncover how austerity can be categorized into different dynamic types, and expose the economic, social, and political implications of the varieties of austerity.

Grounded in primary and secondary literature including theorists\u2019 original writings and leading literary biographies, this text explores principal themes in the development of capitalism and political economic thought.

I am currently working on research supported by a SSHRC Insight Development Grant and UW/SSHRC Explore Seed Grant for archival research (2020-24) on joint-stock royal charter companies, and a SSHRC Insight Grant (2021-24) on public enterprise solutions for post-pandemic recoveries. My book Capitalist Political Economy (2020) recently won the 2022 Rik Davidson/Studies in Political Economy Book Prize In 2020, I received an Arts Award for Excellence in Research. In 2017, I received an Outstanding Performance Award. I am a board member of the journal Studies in Political Economy, co-editor of Alternate Routes: a journal of critical social research, and an International Corresponding Editor for Urban Studies. I am a member of the Waterloo Political Economy Group (WatPEG). Research My research interests include: My research and publications centre on the political economy of privatization, financialization, and fiscal austerity. I have published articles in journals such as Economic Geography, Environment and Planning A, Studies in Political Economy, Urban Studies, and Health Sociology Review. My books are: Varieties of Austerity (with Stephen McBride and Bryan Evans, 2021), Capitalist Political Economy: Thinkers and Theories (2020, Routledge), Canadian Political Economy (editor, 2020, University of Toronto Press), About Canada: Public-Private Partnerships (2016, Fernwood Publishing), Purchase for Profit: public-private partnerships and Canada's public health care system (2015, University of Toronto Press), and Private Affluence, Public Austerity: economic crisis and democratic malaise in Canada (with Stephen McBride, 2011, Fernwood Publishing). Varieties of Austerity Austerity is not always one-size-fits-all; it can be a flexible, class-based strategy taking several forms depending on the political-economic forces and institutional characteristics present. This important book identifies continuity and variety in crisis-driven austerity restructuring across Canada, Denmark, Ireland and Spain. In their analysis, the authors focus on several components of austerity, including fiscal and monetary policy, budget narratives, public sector reform, labor market flexibilization, and resistance. In so doing, they uncover how austerity can be categorized into different dynamic types, and expose the economic, social, and political implications of the varieties of austerity. Capitalist Political Economy: Thinkers and Theorie A key text, Capitalist Political Economy: Thinkers and Theories analyses the field-forming theoretical contributions to political economy that have defined, debated, critiqued, and defended capitalism for more than three centuries. Political economy recognizes and celebrates the many and varied interconnections between politics and economics in society, together with the economic implications of public policy and the political impact of market and property relations. As such, political economy is both an approach to understanding capitalism and a reflection of the forms and features of capitalism at particular moments. Grounded in primary and secondary literature including theorists\u2019 original writings and leading literary biographies, this text explores principal themes in the development of capitalism and political economic thought. It relates these to markets, property, profits, labour, investment, innovation, the state, growth and crises, gender, the ecological limits of capital accumulation, and rival economic practices. The book contextualizes the legacy of foundational political economists by exploring their life and times and putting them in conversation with other highly influential theorists. Equally, it also considers more contemporary views. This book serves as an indispensable source for academic communities who are interested in the long arc of capitalist development, theories, and theorists. Canadian Political EconomyIn Canadian Political Economy, experts from a number of disciplinary backgrounds come together to explore Canada\u2019s empirical political economy and the field's contributions to theory and debate. Considering both historical and contemporary approaches to CPE, the contributors pay particular attention to key actors and institutions, as well as developments in Canadian political-economic policies and practices, explored through themes of changes, crises, and conflicts in CPE. Offering up-to-date interpretations, analyses, and descriptions, Canadian Political Economy is accessibly written and suitable for students and scholars. Through 17 chapters, the book\u2019s topics include theory, history, inequality, work, free trade and fair trade, co-operatives, banking and finance, the environment, indigeneity, and the gendered politics of political economy. Linking longstanding debates with current developments, this volume represents both a state-of-the-discipline and a state-of-the-art contribution to scholarship. Purchase for Profit: Public-Private Partnerships and Canada's Public Health-Care System Canadian provinces have increasingly begun turning to the private sector to finance and construct large-scale infrastructure projects. From a critical public policy perspective, the danger of these public-private partnerships (P3s) is that they are more than just new ways to deliver public infrastructure. They are neoliberal projects that privatize and corporatize the basis of public services.\u200bAnalyzing four Canadian P3 hospital projects, Heather Whiteside argues that P3s not only fail to fulfill the promises made by their proponents but also compromise public control of health policy, outcomes, and future plans. Yet, despite these disadvantages, the use of P3s is being normalized and expanded in BC and Ontario through capital planning frameworks and special government agencies that support and encourage P3 projects. Based on extensive interviews with academic experts, union representatives, provincial government decision-makers, and private sector partners, Purchase for Profit will be important for those studying public policy in any of the areas in which P3s are now being adopted.

I am currently working on research supported by a SSHRC Insight Development Grant and UW/SSHRC Explore Seed Grant for archival research (2020-24) on joint-stock royal charter companies, and a SSHRC Insight Grant (2021-24) on public enterprise solutions for post-pandemic recoveries. My book Capitalist Political Economy (2020) recently won the 2022 Rik Davidson/Studies in Political Economy Book Prize In 2020, I received an Arts Award for Excellence in Research. In 2017, I received an Outstanding Performance Award. I am a board member of the journal Studies in Political Economy, co-editor of Alternate Routes: a journal of critical social research, and an International Corresponding Editor for Urban Studies. I am a member of the Waterloo Political Economy Group (WatPEG). Research My research interests include: My research and publications centre on the political economy of privatization, financialization, and fiscal austerity. I have published articles in journals such as Economic Geography, Environment and Planning A, Studies in Political Economy, Urban Studies, and Health Sociology Review. My books are: Varieties of Austerity (with Stephen McBride and Bryan Evans, 2021), Capitalist Political Economy: Thinkers and Theories (2020, Routledge), Canadian Political Economy (editor, 2020, University of Toronto Press), About Canada: Public-Private Partnerships (2016, Fernwood Publishing), Purchase for Profit: public-private partnerships and Canada's public health care system (2015, University of Toronto Press), and Private Affluence, Public Austerity: economic crisis and democratic malaise in Canada (with Stephen McBride, 2011, Fernwood Publishing). Varieties of Austerity Austerity is not always one-size-fits-all; it can be a flexible, class-based strategy taking several forms depending on the political-economic forces and institutional characteristics present. This important book identifies continuity and variety in crisis-driven austerity restructuring across Canada, Denmark, Ireland and Spain. In their analysis, the authors focus on several components of austerity, including fiscal and monetary policy, budget narratives, public sector reform, labor market flexibilization, and resistance. In so doing, they uncover how austerity can be categorized into different dynamic types, and expose the economic, social, and political implications of the varieties of austerity. Capitalist Political Economy: Thinkers and Theorie A key text, Capitalist Political Economy: Thinkers and Theories analyses the field-forming theoretical contributions to political economy that have defined, debated, critiqued, and defended capitalism for more than three centuries. Political economy recognizes and celebrates the many and varied interconnections between politics and economics in society, together with the economic implications of public policy and the political impact of market and property relations. As such, political economy is both an approach to understanding capitalism and a reflection of the forms and features of capitalism at particular moments. Grounded in primary and secondary literature including theorists\u2019 original writings and leading literary biographies, this text explores principal themes in the development of capitalism and political economic thought. It relates these to markets, property, profits, labour, investment, innovation, the state, growth and crises, gender, the ecological limits of capital accumulation, and rival economic practices. The book contextualizes the legacy of foundational political economists by exploring their life and times and putting them in conversation with other highly influential theorists. Equally, it also considers more contemporary views. This book serves as an indispensable source for academic communities who are interested in the long arc of capitalist development, theories, and theorists. Canadian Political EconomyIn Canadian Political Economy, experts from a number of disciplinary backgrounds come together to explore Canada\u2019s empirical political economy and the field's contributions to theory and debate. Considering both historical and contemporary approaches to CPE, the contributors pay particular attention to key actors and institutions, as well as developments in Canadian political-economic policies and practices, explored through themes of changes, crises, and conflicts in CPE. Offering up-to-date interpretations, analyses, and descriptions, Canadian Political Economy is accessibly written and suitable for students and scholars. Through 17 chapters, the book\u2019s topics include theory, history, inequality, work, free trade and fair trade, co-operatives, banking and finance, the environment, indigeneity, and the gendered politics of political economy. Linking longstanding debates with current developments, this volume represents both a state-of-the-discipline and a state-of-the-art contribution to scholarship. Purchase for Profit: Public-Private Partnerships and Canada's Public Health-Care System Canadian provinces have increasingly begun turning to the private sector to finance and construct large-scale infrastructure projects. From a critical public policy perspective, the danger of these public-private partnerships (P3s) is that they are more than just new ways to deliver public infrastructure. They are neoliberal projects that privatize and corporatize the basis of public services.\u200bAnalyzing four Canadian P3 hospital projects, Heather Whiteside argues that P3s not only fail to fulfill the promises made by their proponents but also compromise public control of health policy, outcomes, and future plans. Yet, despite these disadvantages, the use of P3s is being normalized and expanded in BC and Ontario through capital planning frameworks and special government agencies that support and encourage P3 projects. Based on extensive interviews with academic experts, union representatives, provincial government decision-makers, and private sector partners, Purchase for Profit will be important for those studying public policy in any of the areas in which P3s are now being adopted. Current teaching PS 690 Theories of Political Economy PSCI 428/631 The State and Economic Life PSCI 300 Foundations of Political Economy PSCI 231 Government and Business Teaching philosophy: I teach political science courses from a political economy perspective, my aim being to inspire students\u2019 curiosity into the dynamic relationship that exists between the political and the economic (variously conceived). Students in my classes learn not only about political economy theory and practice, they engage in critical thinking about how these forces shape society and their everyday lives.

In their analysis, the authors focus on several components of austerity, including fiscal and monetary policy, budget narratives, public sector reform, labor market flexibilization, and resistance. In so doing, they uncover how austerity can be categorized into different dynamic types, and expose the economic, social, and political implications of the varieties of austerity.\nCapitalist Political Economy: Thinkers and Theorie\nCapitalist Political Economy: Thinkers and Theorie\nCapitalist Political Economy: Thinkers and Theorie\nA key text, Capitalist Political Economy: Thinkers and Theories analyses the field-forming theoretical contributions to political economy that have defined, debated, critiqued, and defended capitalism for more than three centuries.\nCapitalist Political Economy: Thinkers and Theories \nPolitical economy recognizes and celebrates the many and varied interconnections between politics and economics in society, together with the economic implications of public policy and the political impact of market and property relations. As such, political economy is both an approach to understanding capitalism and a reflection of the forms and features of capitalism at particular moments. Grounded in primary and secondary literature including theorists\u2019 original writings and leading literary biographies, this text explores principal themes in the development of capitalism and political economic thought. It relates these to markets, property, profits, labour, investment, innovation, the state, growth and crises, gender, the ecological limits of capital accumulation, and rival economic practices. The book contextualizes the legacy of foundational political economists by exploring their life and times and putting them in conversation with other highly influential theorists. Equally, it also considers more contemporary views. \nThis book serves as an indispensable source for academic communities who are interested in the long arc of capitalist development, theories, and theorists.\nThis book serves as an indispensable source for academic communities who are interested in the long arc of capitalist development, theories, and theorists.\nCanadian Political EconomyIn Canadian Political Economy, experts from a number of disciplinary backgrounds come together to explore Canada\u2019s empirical political economy and the field's contributions to theory and debate. Considering both historical and contemporary approaches to CPE, the contributors pay particular attention to key actors and institutions, as well as developments in Canadian political-economic policies and practices, explored through themes of changes, crises, and conflicts in CPE. Offering up-to-date interpretations, analyses, and descriptions, Canadian Political Economy is accessibly written and suitable for students and scholars. Through 17 chapters, the book\u2019s topics include theory, history, inequality, work, free trade and fair trade, co-operatives, banking and finance, the environment, indigeneity, and the gendered politics of political economy. Linking longstanding debates with current developments, this volume represents both a state-of-the-discipline and a state-of-the-art contribution to scholarship.\nCanadian Political Economy\nCanadian Political Economy\n\n\nIn \nCanadian Political Economy\n, experts from a number of disciplinary backgrounds come together to explore Canada\u2019s empirical political economy and the field's contributions to theory and debate.

From a critical public policy perspective, the danger of these public-private partnerships (P3s) is that they are more than just new ways to deliver public infrastructure. They are neoliberal projects that privatize and corporatize the basis of public services.\u200bAnalyzing four Canadian P3 hospital projects, Heather Whiteside argues that P3s not only fail to fulfill the promises made by their proponents but also compromise public control of health policy, outcomes, and future plans. Yet, despite these disadvantages, the use of P3s is being normalized and expanded in BC and Ontario through capital planning frameworks and special government agencies that support and encourage P3 projects. Based on extensive interviews with academic experts, union representatives, provincial government decision-makers, and private sector partners, Purchase for Profit will be important for those studying public policy in any of the areas in which P3s are now being adopted.\nCanadian provinces have increasingly begun turning to the private sector to finance and construct large-scale infrastructure projects.

Website of Diversity and Intergroup Relations Lab Publons Profile I will be accepting graduate student applications for Fall 2024 Research interests My research examines the interpersonal dynamics of intergroup interactions and relationships -- probing impression management, strategic communication, nonverbal behaviour, affect, depletion, and trust -- to understand when and why problems can arise even in the absence of animus. I use a relational approach to analyze asymmetries in experiences of individuals from different groups as they interact and develop relationships (e.g., as friends, classmates, coworkers). Because distrust between societal groups is pervasive and close relationships normally involve conflicts that could undermine trust, investigating how trust is established, maintained, and repaired in intergroup close relationships is a timely, crucial challenge in our increasingly multicultural society. Another line of work focuses on collaborative social cognition, identifying covert channels through which negative impressions and stereotypes propagate from communicators to audiences. Criticism and stereotypes can be strategically suppressed (negativity omission) and then inferred (via innuendo) in conversation, limiting opportunities for individuals from historically stigmatized groups.

Website of Diversity and Intergroup Relations Lab Publons Profile I will be accepting graduate student applications for Fall 2024 Research interests My research examines the interpersonal dynamics of intergroup interactions and relationships -- probing impression management, strategic communication, nonverbal behaviour, affect, depletion, and trust -- to understand when and why problems can arise even in the absence of animus. I use a relational approach to analyze asymmetries in experiences of individuals from different groups as they interact and develop relationships (e.g., as friends, classmates, coworkers). Because distrust between societal groups is pervasive and close relationships normally involve conflicts that could undermine trust, investigating how trust is established, maintained, and repaired in intergroup close relationships is a timely, crucial challenge in our increasingly multicultural society. Another line of work focuses on collaborative social cognition, identifying covert channels through which negative impressions and stereotypes propagate from communicators to audiences. Criticism and stereotypes can be strategically suppressed (negativity omission) and then inferred (via innuendo) in conversation, limiting opportunities for individuals from historically stigmatized groups.

I became interested in boredom when working with people who had suffered traumatic brain injuries \u2013 typically from things like car crashes. They reported feeling more bored than before their injury and I believed this to be an organic change in brain function not a psychological reaction. We study boredom in a wide range of ways: behavioural tasks like foraging which pit exploration against exploitation, sustained attention tasks that are by design monotonous and dull and executive control tasks that to some extent will tap into the capacity for self-control. We use neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI and more recently tDCS and we have an ongoing collaboration with an evolutionary geneticist to explore the genetic basis of boredom \u2013 all ultimately to understand the antecedents and mechanisms that give rise to boredom. Our work on mental model updating was born out of work on the neglect syndrome \u2013 typically arising from right parietal neglect patients behave as though the left half of the world has ceased to exist. But the disorder is more nuanced than a simple model of deficient leftward orienting of attention would suggest. Patients also have problems with visual working memory, sustained attention, and temporal perception which can\u2019t be explained by a simple problem of attention. Together with my colleague Britt Anderson we developed a theory that suggests a network of predominantly right hemisphere brain regions is important for representing regularities in the world (i.e., building a mental model) and updating those representations when contingencies change. We work with stroke patients (we have a database of over 800 patients to recruit into research projects), fMRI and computational modelling to explore the mechanisms and neural networks important to model building and updating.

Graduate course Psych 783: Neuroimaging and Cognition The first section of this course (~ 3 to 4 lectures worth) will introduce you to the fundamental aspects of functional MRI both in terms of the physics involved and the issues surrounding design and analysis (some comparison with other brain imaging techniques such as VEPs, TMS, PET etc. will also be covered). The second section intends to explore how fMRI can illuminate our models of various aspects of cognition, including attention, vision, language, memory and learning, executive functions, emotion and if time permits, various neuropathologies. \n BA (Melbourne University, Australia), MA, PhD (La Trobe University, Australia) Contact information Danckert Lab Danckert Google Scholar Page Former Canada Research Chair (Tier II) in Cognitive Neuroscience Recipient, 40 Under 40 Award, Region of Waterloo Research interests I have two research programs in my lab that are relatively independent from one another: boredom and mental model updating. I became interested in boredom when working with people who had suffered traumatic brain injuries \u2013 typically from things like car crashes. They reported feeling more bored than before their injury and I believed this to be an organic change in brain function not a psychological reaction. We study boredom in a wide range of ways: behavioural tasks like foraging which pit exploration against exploitation, sustained attention tasks that are by design monotonous and dull and executive control tasks that to some extent will tap into the capacity for self-control. We use neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI and more recently tDCS and we have an ongoing collaboration with an evolutionary geneticist to explore the genetic basis of boredom \u2013 all ultimately to understand the antecedents and mechanisms that give rise to boredom. Our work on mental model updating was born out of work on the neglect syndrome \u2013 typically arising from right parietal neglect patients behave as though the left half of the world has ceased to exist. But the disorder is more nuanced than a simple model of deficient leftward orienting of attention would suggest. Patients also have problems with visual working memory, sustained attention, and temporal perception which can\u2019t be explained by a simple problem of attention. Together with my colleague Britt Anderson we developed a theory that suggests a network of predominantly right hemisphere brain regions is important for representing regularities in the world (i.e., building a mental model) and updating those representations when contingencies change. We work with stroke patients (we have a database of over 800 patients to recruit into research projects), fMRI and computational modelling to explore the mechanisms and neural networks important to model building and updating.

Over the last decade my research program has investigated gambling behaviour. Much of our research has focused on some of the deceptive features of multiline slot machines. In 2010 we coined the term \u201closses disguised as wins\u201d to describe slots outcomes where players for example bet 1$ on a spin and win back 20 cents. Despite this outcome being a net loss, the machine plays highly engaging animations and celebratory sounds that are similar in character to the reinforcing sounds played true wins. Our work on losses disguised as wins has led to policy changes in Australia. More recently we coined the term \u201cdark flow\u201d to describe the unusual state of absorption that problem players especially experience while playing slots. This state appears to be sought after by depressed players who use slot machine play as a maladaptive coping mechanism. The reinforcing sights and sounds of the slot machine captures their attention, preventing their minds from wandering to negative places. Funding sources.
