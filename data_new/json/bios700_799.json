Much of her research has taken place in Asia, with an emphasis on community-based disaster recovery and reconstruction. Erin\u2019s teaching has focused more broadly on environmental studies, examining the human interactions with the natural world. \n\n\n Recent Courses Taught ENVS 195: Introduction to Environmental Studies \n Recent Courses Taught\n\n Research Interests My research focuses on disaster risk reduction in both developed and developing country contexts. I am particularly interested in examining post-disaster livelihood recovery and housing reconstruction processes, exploring how recovery programming can reduce vulnerability to future hazards, and increase resilience to face a multitude of stressors. My current research focuses on the ways in which disasters and religion intersect, including an examination of the impact of disasters on an individuals\u2019 faith, their relationship with their community, and their perception of the environment. \n Research Interests\n\n Recent Publications \n Recent Publications\n O\u2019Connell, E.P., Abbott, R.P., & White, R.S.

Specific questions of interest to him include trace gas exchange in wetland and forested systems, interactions between vegetation and hydrology and climate (weather), and modeling the impacts of climatic and land-use stresses on these linkages. Rich\u2019s research currently focuses on high latitude systems, specifically the Western Boreal Forest, where he is actively involved with these research questions and their applicability to landscape reclamation. However, he is also a lead-PI and node leader in the Southern Ontario Water Consortium where he is examining the effects of agriculture and landuse change on water quantity and quality in Southern Ontario.

This involves combining theoretical, laboratory and fieldwork examining micrometeorological, hydrological and trace gas exchange in heterogeneous vegetated systems. My research philosophy is grounded in the belief that the development of theory and experimentation must progress in conjunction with one another. My long-term objectives involve issues of scaling in the development of fully coupled biogeochemical-hydrological models of climate change while developing realistic sound strategies for adapting to potential climate and landuse change scenarios, with specific applications post-industrial disturbance reclamation. Current research projects include examining and linking hydrology, ecology and disturbance in the Western Boreal Forest; restoration/reclamation of wetland ecosystems impacted by oil and gas, and soil sands development; carbon and water exchange in the Boreal-Subarctic transition zone; the role of ice in high latitude wetland ecohydrological processes; and carbon-nutrient cycling in temperate multiple landuse agricultural basins.

Key Areas of Graduate Supervision Ecohydrology, hydrometeorology, climatology, micrometeorology, climate change, biogeochemistry, greenhouse gases, reclamation, landuse change, forest hydrology Recent Courses Taught GEM 641: Physical Dimensions of Climate Change GEM642: Introductory Micrometeorology Research Interests My present research focuses on catchment ecohydrological processes and their influence on wetland permanence, wetland reclamation and forest hydroclimatological and biogeochemical processes in stressed northern ecosystems (Western Boreal Forest, Subarctic Wetland-Tundra). This involves combining theoretical, laboratory and fieldwork examining micrometeorological, hydrological and trace gas exchange in heterogeneous vegetated systems. My research philosophy is grounded in the belief that the development of theory and experimentation must progress in conjunction with one another. My long-term objectives involve issues of scaling in the development of fully coupled biogeochemical-hydrological models of climate change while developing realistic sound strategies for adapting to potential climate and landuse change scenarios, with specific applications post-industrial disturbance reclamation. Current research projects include examining and linking hydrology, ecology and disturbance in the Western Boreal Forest; restoration/reclamation of wetland ecosystems impacted by oil and gas, and soil sands development; carbon and water exchange in the Boreal-Subarctic transition zone; the role of ice in high latitude wetland ecohydrological processes; and carbon-nutrient cycling in temperate multiple landuse agricultural basins.

A particular focus has been on two-way interactions of climate change and tourism, understanding the implications of a changing climate and climate sensitive environmental systems for tourism at the tourist, operator, destination and tourism region scales, as well as the contribution the global tourism sector makes to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and land use change. This research also examines government and business climate change mitigation and adaptation policy and planning, as well as consumer responses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while on holiday. Other research interests include the use of forecasts and scenarios in tourism planning and climate change and protected areas management. Recent Publications: Knowles, N., Scott, D., Steiger, R.

A particular focus has been on two-way interactions of climate change and tourism, understanding the implications of a changing climate and climate sensitive environmental systems for tourism at the tourist, operator, destination and tourism region scales, as well as the contribution the global tourism sector makes to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and land use change. This research also examines government and business climate change mitigation and adaptation policy and planning, as well as consumer responses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while on holiday. Other research interests include the use of forecasts and scenarios in tourism planning and climate change and protected areas management.\nResearch Interests\n\nRecent Publications:\nRecent Publications:\nRecent Publications:\nRecent Publications:\nKnowles, N., Scott, D., Steiger, R.

His research interests are broadly related to the study of land use change and its impacts on sediment transport dynamics and water quality in both natural and built environments. He has worked in a wide range of geographical locations that include the lower Great Lakes basin, Slave River delta (NWT), the Coppermine River Basin (NWT), eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains (Alberta) and China (Inner Mongolia). For the past 13 years he has been a member of the Southern Rockies Watershed Project (SRWP) research team. SRWP was established to rigorously examine the effects of wildfire on hydrology, water quality, stream health and the downstream implications of this disturbance to water treatment. His current research is designed to quantify and model the impacts of contemporary forest harvesting strategies on sediment and associated nutrient transport dynamics. This research will be used to refine sediment transport models and enable land managers to select harvesting strategies to manage wildfire risks while potentially mitigating downstream propagation of sediment and associated nutrients.

He has worked in a wide range of geographical locations that include the lower Great Lakes basin, Slave River delta (NWT), the Coppermine River Basin (NWT), eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains (Alberta) and China (Inner Mongolia). For the past 13 years he has been a member of the Southern Rockies Watershed Project (SRWP) research team. SRWP was established to rigorously examine the effects of wildfire on hydrology, water quality, stream health and the downstream implications of this disturbance to water treatment. His current research is designed to quantify and model the impacts of contemporary forest harvesting strategies on sediment and associated nutrient transport dynamics. This research will be used to refine sediment transport models and enable land managers to select harvesting strategies to manage wildfire risks while potentially mitigating downstream propagation of sediment and associated nutrients.

I collaborate on several peatland restoration projects across Canada involving restoration of sites used for horticultural peat extraction, former well-pads and roads related to oil extraction, and peatland construction in oil sands mining regions. My interest in these projects is evaluating the conditions that help to return a carbon accumulation function post-restoration. I am also investigating the potential impact of climate change on peatlands through plot to ecosystem scale manipulation of temperature and water table and evaluating the subsequent changes in soil properties, plant community and greenhouse gas fluxes. I am also particularly interested in peatland methane dynamics including both fluxes and subsurface storage. As part of this research we are using a variety of geophysical techniques to monitor gas accumulation and release while also investigating the physical soil properties and hydrochemical and microbiological conditions that are related to spatial patterns of gas accumulation.

I collaborate on several peatland restoration projects across Canada involving restoration of sites used for horticultural peat extraction, former well-pads and roads related to oil extraction, and peatland construction in oil sands mining regions. My interest in these projects is evaluating the conditions that help to return a carbon accumulation function post-restoration. I am also investigating the potential impact of climate change on peatlands through plot to ecosystem scale manipulation of temperature and water table and evaluating the subsequent changes in soil properties, plant community and greenhouse gas fluxes.

To visit Maria's research website, see the Wetland Soils and Greenhouse Gas Exchange Lab. Key Areas of Graduate Supervision Soil greenhouse gas fluxes, wetland restoration, ecohydrology, organic soil physics, mitigation of land-use change greenhouse gas fluxes Recent Courses Taught GEOG294: Approaches to Research in Physical Geography Research Interests My current research focuses on peatland greenhouse gas fluxes in both natural and disturbed ecosystems. I collaborate on several peatland restoration projects across Canada involving restoration of sites used for horticultural peat extraction, former well-pads and roads related to oil extraction, and peatland construction in oil sands mining regions. My interest in these projects is evaluating the conditions that help to return a carbon accumulation function post-restoration. I am also investigating the potential impact of climate change on peatlands through plot to ecosystem scale manipulation of temperature and water table and evaluating the subsequent changes in soil properties, plant community and greenhouse gas fluxes. I am also particularly interested in peatland methane dynamics including both fluxes and subsurface storage. As part of this research we are using a variety of geophysical techniques to monitor gas accumulation and release while also investigating the physical soil properties and hydrochemical and microbiological conditions that are related to spatial patterns of gas accumulation.

She is the Executive Director of the Waterloo Climate Institute, a Lead Author of the United Nations\u2019 Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and helped to lead expert input into the development of Canada\u2019s first National Adaptation Strategy. Her research uncovers transformative responses to climate change at the community scale, the political and justice dimensions of energy transitions, and the unique contributions that small businesses can make to this solving these complex challenges. She leads the international partnership-based research project TRANSFORM: Accelerating sustainability entrepreneurship experiments in local spaces, and is the Director of the Sustainability Policy Research on Urban Transformations (SPROUT) Lab. Dr. Burch holds a PhD from the University of British Columbia, and held a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Oxford\u2019s Environmental Change Institute.

Her most recent book is entitled \u2018Understanding Climate Change: Science, Policy and Practice,\u2019 and she taught the first Massive Open Online Course on climate change, which reached thousands over students in over 130 countries. Key Areas of Graduate SupervisionSustainability transitions, climate change governance, mitigation and adaptation in cities, sustainability entrepreneurship within small businesses, participatory scenario development. Upcoming Courses GEOG 675 Climate Change Governance Research InterestsMy research addresses the question of transformative change in response to climate change and sustainability challenges. I explore the roots of vulnerability and carbon-intensive development by examining the inertia built into our modes of governance, urban planning, and participatory processes. Current projects that are under way employ comparative policy analysis and institutional theory, paired with the concepts of path dependency and sustainability transitions, to investigate how communities use stocks of capacity to respond to climate change. I also examine unique partnerships between the public and private sector that may serve to transform regional development paths and mitigate climate change, the use of \u2018green infrastructure\u2019 to achieve both adaptation and mitigation, and the triggers of climate change leadership in Canadian communities.

She is the Executive Director of the Waterloo Climate Institute, a Lead Author of the United Nations\u2019 Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and helped to lead expert input into the development of Canada\u2019s first National Adaptation Strategy. Her research uncovers transformative responses to climate change at the community scale, the political and justice dimensions of energy transitions, and the unique contributions that small businesses can make to this solving these complex challenges. She leads the international partnership-based research project TRANSFORM: Accelerating sustainability entrepreneurship experiments in local spaces, and is the Director of the Sustainability Policy Research on Urban Transformations (SPROUT) Lab.

Her most recent book is entitled \u2018Understanding Climate Change: Science, Policy and Practice,\u2019 and she taught the first Massive Open Online Course on climate change, which reached thousands over students in over 130 countries. Key Areas of Graduate SupervisionSustainability transitions, climate change governance, mitigation and adaptation in cities, sustainability entrepreneurship within small businesses, participatory scenario development. Upcoming Courses GEOG 675 Climate Change Governance Research InterestsMy research addresses the question of transformative change in response to climate change and sustainability challenges. I explore the roots of vulnerability and carbon-intensive development by examining the inertia built into our modes of governance, urban planning, and participatory processes. Current projects that are under way employ comparative policy analysis and institutional theory, paired with the concepts of path dependency and sustainability transitions, to investigate how communities use stocks of capacity to respond to climate change. I also examine unique partnerships between the public and private sector that may serve to transform regional development paths and mitigate climate change, the use of \u2018green infrastructure\u2019 to achieve both adaptation and mitigation, and the triggers of climate change leadership in Canadian communities.

She is the Executive Director of the Waterloo Climate Institute, a Lead Author of the United Nations\u2019 Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and helped to lead expert input into the development of Canada\u2019s first National Adaptation Strategy. Her research uncovers transformative responses to climate change at the community scale, the political and justice dimensions of energy transitions, and the unique contributions that small businesses can make to this solving these complex challenges. She leads the international partnership-based research project TRANSFORM: Accelerating sustainability entrepreneurship experiments in local spaces, and is the Director of the Sustainability Policy Research on Urban Transformations (SPROUT) Lab. Dr. Burch holds a PhD from the University of British Columbia, and held a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Oxford\u2019s Environmental Change Institute. She was named to the Royal Society of Canada\u2019s College of New Scholars in 2017, one of Canada\u2019s Top 40 Under 40TM in 2018, and one of Canada\u2019s Clean 50 in 2021. Her most recent book is entitled \u2018Understanding Climate Change: Science, Policy and Practice,\u2019 and she taught the first Massive Open Online Course on climate change, which reached thousands over students in over 130 countries. Key Areas of Graduate SupervisionSustainability transitions, climate change governance, mitigation and adaptation in cities, sustainability entrepreneurship within small businesses, participatory scenario development. Upcoming Courses GEOG 675 Climate Change Governance Research InterestsMy research addresses the question of transformative change in response to climate change and sustainability challenges. I explore the roots of vulnerability and carbon-intensive development by examining the inertia built into our modes of governance, urban planning, and participatory processes. Current projects that are under way employ comparative policy analysis and institutional theory, paired with the concepts of path dependency and sustainability transitions, to investigate how communities use stocks of capacity to respond to climate change. I also examine unique partnerships between the public and private sector that may serve to transform regional development paths and mitigate climate change, the use of \u2018green infrastructure\u2019 to achieve both adaptation and mitigation, and the triggers of climate change leadership in Canadian communities.

Upcoming Courses GEOG 675 Climate Change Governance Research InterestsMy research addresses the question of transformative change in response to climate change and sustainability challenges. I explore the roots of vulnerability and carbon-intensive development by examining the inertia built into our modes of governance, urban planning, and participatory processes. Current projects that are under way employ comparative policy analysis and institutional theory, paired with the concepts of path dependency and sustainability transitions, to investigate how communities use stocks of capacity to respond to climate change. I also examine unique partnerships between the public and private sector that may serve to transform regional development paths and mitigate climate change, the use of \u2018green infrastructure\u2019 to achieve both adaptation and mitigation, and the triggers of climate change leadership in Canadian communities.

He also examines digital media, equity finance, entrepreneurship, gender and sexuality, and emotions and affect in the workplace. Courses Offered Fall terms: GEOG100 - On Becoming a Geography GEOG302 - Geography of Work and Employment (Co-taught with Dr. Nancy Worth, GEM) Spring terms: GEOG202 - Geography of the Global Economy (Also offered in Winter terms) GEOG411 - The Digital Economy Key Areas of Graduate Supervision Cultural geography, critical human geography, economic geography, entrepreneurialism and startup economies, feminist geography, queer geography and sexuality. Daniel is currently seeking graduate students for supervision at the MA and PhD level. Please contact him by email with a CV and writing sample if you are interested. Research Interests Daniel focusses his empirical research on working culture, anti-work politics, and neoliberalism, taking up feminist and cultural lenses in economic geography to approach these themes. His current research, building on doctoral work in San Francisco and Silicon Valley with entrepreneurs and others working for startup firms, examines entrepreneurship and education in the Waterloo-Kitchener context. He is currently developing a research agenda around the relationship between sexuality and work, that could include investigations into the relationship between labor movements and LGBTQ activism, the political economy of pride protests, and the often popular and liberal uptake of diversity and inclusion programmes in businesses across North America. Theoretically, Daniel\u2019s research is influenced by social theory, including feminist theory, Marx\u2019s writing, political theory, post-structuralism, psychoanalysis, and queer and affect theory. In particular his theoretical research has focused on the early writing of philosopher Gilles Deleuze, prior to (though without ignoring) his later collaborations with F\u00e9lix Guattari. Additionally, Daniel also investigates the relationship between queer theory and software studies, and is engaged in feminist critiques of knowledge production in geography particularly through the practice of academic citation conceptualized as a method for reproducing academic authority in the discipline.

Courses Offered Fall terms: GEOG100 - On Becoming a Geography GEOG302 - Geography of Work and Employment (Co-taught with Dr. Nancy Worth, GEM) Spring terms: GEOG202 - Geography of the Global Economy (Also offered in Winter terms) GEOG411 - The Digital Economy Key Areas of Graduate Supervision Cultural geography, critical human geography, economic geography, entrepreneurialism and startup economies, feminist geography, queer geography and sexuality. Daniel is currently seeking graduate students for supervision at the MA and PhD level. Please contact him by email with a CV and writing sample if you are interested. Research Interests Daniel focusses his empirical research on working culture, anti-work politics, and neoliberalism, taking up feminist and cultural lenses in economic geography to approach these themes. His current research, building on doctoral work in San Francisco and Silicon Valley with entrepreneurs and others working for startup firms, examines entrepreneurship and education in the Waterloo-Kitchener context. He is currently developing a research agenda around the relationship between sexuality and work, that could include investigations into the relationship between labor movements and LGBTQ activism, the political economy of pride protests, and the often popular and liberal uptake of diversity and inclusion programmes in businesses across North America. Theoretically, Daniel\u2019s research is influenced by social theory, including feminist theory, Marx\u2019s writing, political theory, post-structuralism, psychoanalysis, and queer and affect theory. In particular his theoretical research has focused on the early writing of philosopher Gilles Deleuze, prior to (though without ignoring) his later collaborations with F\u00e9lix Guattari. Additionally, Daniel also investigates the relationship between queer theory and software studies, and is engaged in feminist critiques of knowledge production in geography particularly through the practice of academic citation conceptualized as a method for reproducing academic authority in the discipline.

Within this broad theme, his interests include hazard mitigation and disaster risk reduction; post-disaster reconstruction; institutional capacity building; sustainable resource and environmental management, and; and parks and protected areas. Key Areas of Graduate Supervision Hazard mitigation and disaster risk reduction; climate change/hazards connections; Environmental and resource management in developing countries; and; institutional capacity building. Over the next three years (2016-2018) I am especially keen to supervise students in the \"hazards/disaster risk reduction\" and \"sustainable resource and environmental management\" themes. Recent Courses Taught GEOG101: Geography and Human Habitat GEOG206: Human Dimensions of Natural Hazards GEOG356: Resources Management GEOG430C/692: Field Research in Regional Geography (Indonesia, Dominican Republic) GEMCC622/677: Climate Change, Natural Hazards and Disaster Risk Reduction GEOG673: International Perspectives on Resource and Environmental Management Research Interests My research interests lie in the general field of resource and environmental management in developing countries, with more specific interests in: sustainable resource and environmental management; hazard mitigation and disaster risk reduction; post-disaster reconstruction; climate change/hazards connections; institutional capacity building; waste management in developing countries, and; parks and protected areas. My most recent research projects have explored post-disaster adaptations at multiple scales, ranging from individual and household-level adaptations to national-level adaptations.

Eng.) is an award-winning teacher, researcher, entrepreneur, published novelist, and the inventor of photoacoustic/photon-absorption remote sensing (PARS\u00ae) microscopy. He is a founder of illumiSonics Inc., where he held the position of CEO from 2014 to 2018; he remains the CTO and Chairman of the Board, where he leads all scientific research and technology development and oversees major company decisions and policies. illumiSonics under Dr. Haji Reza's leadership raised private investments (+$10M) and attracted notable individuals and international companies. Dr. Haji Reza Joined the University of Waterloo in April 2018 as an assistant professor and promoted to associate professor in July 2023. He received the Faculty of Engineering Distinguished Performance Award (2020), Engineering Research Excellence Award (2021), and Outstanding Performance Award (2022). In addition, for the work he has done to support the mental health of the students during the pandemic, he received the Engineering Society Friend of Natalie Award. Since October 2022, Dr. Haji Reza has been appointed as \u200ba Research Chair in Biomedical Imaging at the University of Waterloo. For his contribution to the field of ophthalmology, he has been appointed as a translational medical staff at the Wills Eye hospital. Wills Eye Hospital is ranked as one of the top three ophthalmology hospitals in the United States. It was established in 1832 and is the oldest continually operating eye-care facility in the United States. He has established PhotoMedicine Labs at the University of Waterloo (2019), which has attracted, trained, and retained top biomedical engineering students from across Canada and internationally. PhotoMedicine Labs is funded by industry collaborators and top granting agencies in Canada (e.g., New Frontiers Exploration grant, CIHR project grant, NSERC Discovery Horizons) and has garnered ~$6 M since 2019 (with ~1M expected annually in the next five years). Dr. Haji Reza \u2018s current research focuses on developing the first real-time cancer surgical microscope to enable immediate tissue biopsy and full tumour resection during surgery, as well as the first clinical ophthalmic imaging tool capable of pre-diagnosing eye-blinding diseases before they become symptomatic (this is not currently possible). Since 2019, the lab has published numerous high-impact peer-reviewed articles, reporting breakthroughs in histological, oncological, ophthalmological and endoscopic imaging that could revolutionize the way the world looks at tissues. In general, Dr. Haji Reza and his team are interested in designing and developing novel hardware and software methods for clinical and pre-clinical biomedical applications. These new technologies aim to provide clinicians and researchers with novel capabilities and information that is presently difficult to obtain with existing techniques. He invented and pioneered several new technologies/concepts including, Photoacoustic Remote Sensing (PARS\u00ae) microscopy, a novel absorption-based, non-contact, non-invasive, label-free imaging technique. Dr. Haji Reza and his team continually strive to maintain an extremely dynamic, respectful, intellectual, fun, and creative environment. The team is working on cutting-edge research in biomedical engineering and biophotonics, including non-invasive non-contact optical imaging methods, micro-endoscopy designs, handheld, and portable medical imaging techniques, design, and fabrication of nano-structured sensors, image processing, Machine Learning methods, Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers, and novel deep optical imaging tomography methods. The team pursues applications in ophthalmology, oncology, dermatology, neurology, cardiology, dentistry, pharmaceutical, and pre-clinical research. The research philosophy of PhotoMedicine labs is transitional research from bench to the bedside. We are always looking to collaborate with talented students, faculties, researchers, clinicians, and industry.

Dr. Jiang's research leverages signal processing methods and artificial intelligence algorithms for biological signals, such as Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG), for neurorehabilitation engineering applications. In particular, his research focuses on new human-machine interfacing (HMI) technologies, including brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and muscle-man-interfaces (MMI). His innovations have resulted in new, more effective upper limb prosthetic control technologies and accelerated rehabilitation of motor functions for patients suffering from disorders, such as stroke. His research has also been applied more broadly to HMI for applications in kinesiology, neural plasticity (cortical and peripheral), ergonomics, and other related areas. These contributions have not only advanced the scientific knowledge of the field but have also achieved direct impacts on the biomedical industry as described below. \nTo date, Dr. Jiang has authored and co-authored 84 refereed journal papers and 83 conference papers (full-length papers and extended abstracts), primarily within the top-most venues for the biomedical engineering, neurorehabilitation, neurophysiology, signal processing, machine intelligence, and related disciplines. Nearly half of his journal papers were published in EMBS\u2019 transactions and journals. That these contributions are achieving impact is clear from how often they have been cited (Web of Science: 2681, H-index: 23, Google: 4579, H-index 30), and that Dr. Jiang has been invited to present his work at 11 different international conferences, as plenary speaker, workshop speaker, etc. \nSince he started his independent academic career in 2015, Dr. Jiang secured over $2 million (CAD) direction research fund in peer-reviewed competitions to support his program (as PI and co-PI). This includes the NSERC Discovery Accelerator Supplement, awarded to only 4% of thousands of applicants in the annual competition. This is a rare feat for a first-time applicant. Dr. Jiang was also awarded the highly competitive 2018 Early Researcher Award by the Province of Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation, and Science, and most recently, Dr. Jiang was awarded the COVID-19 Alliance grant from NSERC in 2020. \nDr. Jiang has supervised and co-supervised four post-doctoral fellows, six Ph.D., 21 Master, and 14 undergraduate students. Five Ph.D. students under his day-to-day supervision have successfully defended their Ph.D. degrees. The vast majority of these 40+ early-stage researchers have moved on to research positions in academia, government, or the private sector. \nDr. Jiang\u2019s service to the scientific and engineering community has been extensive, including as an Associate Editor for the IEEE Journal in Biomedical and Health Informatics, Frontiers in Neuroscience, and the Brain-Computer Interfaces. He also Co-Chaired the Neurorehabilitation and Prosthetics Symposium at the IEEE International Neural Engineering Conference (2017), was Track Chair of the Myoelectric Control Symposium (2017), was Associate Editor for the IEEE International Conference of Robotics and Automation (2016), and will Co-Chair the upcoming workshop on BCI in aging research at the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (2018). He was elevated to Senior Member of IEEE/EMBS in 2014.\nResearch interests\n Biological signal processing Human-machine interfaces (HMI) Biomedical Engineering Neurophysiology Neurorehabilitation Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) Electromyography (EMG) Electroencephalogram (EEG) Electrocardiogram (ECG) functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) Cognitive Stress eHealth mHealth Medical Robotics \nBiological signal processing\nHuman-machine interfaces (HMI)\nBiomedical Engineering\nNeurophysiology\nNeurorehabilitation\nBrain-Computer Interface (BCI)\nBrain-Machine Interface (BMI)\nElectromyography (EMG)\nElectroencephalogram (EEG)\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\nfunctional Near-infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)\nCognitive Stress\neHealth\nmHealth\nMedical Robotics\nEducation\n 2009, Doctorate, Biomedical Engineering, University of New Brunswick 2004, Master of Applied Science, Biomedical Engineering, University of New Brunswick 1998, Bachelor of Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University \n 2009, Doctorate, Biomedical Engineering, University of New Brunswick \n 2004, Master of Applied Science, Biomedical Engineering, University of New Brunswick \n 1998, Bachelor of Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University \nCourses*\n SYDE 252 -

His earlier research has resulted in commercial laser-camera range-sensors and worldwide used CAD/CAM systems in prosthetics. In addition, three patents were recently issued for: unconstrained range-sensing for application in a hand-held 3D scanner and 3D robot-vision scanner; an articulating joint for human-assistive devices and robotic applications; and full-field optical/vision-based 3D surface shape measurement. \nProfessor Kofman\u2019s research lab, Intelligent Human Machine Systems Lab/ Optomechatronic Systems Laboratories, has done work in human-assistive orthotic-system design and biomechatronic systems in collaboration with Dr. Edward Lemaire of the Ottawa Hospital Rehabilitation Centre. Their research has led to new designs of a Stance-Control Knee-Ankle-Foot Orthosis (SCKAFO). The SCKAFO is a leg brace that first locks the knee joint when the leg is weight bearing (to support the weight of the body). It then unlocks the knee when the leg is unloaded, to permit the knee to flex, in order to allow the leg to swing forward smoothly with the foot clearing the ground while taking the next step. Ongoing research includes clinical testing of the new orthoses, design of new wearable human-assistive robotic/orthotic systems, and development of measurement and analysis systems for assessing dynamic stability in human walking. One patent has been issued and another one is pending related to this biomedical research. \nProfessor Kofman has been co-recipient and co-author of several research paper/research awards, and was awarded the En-Hui Yang Engineering Research Innovation Award from the UWaterloo Faculty of Engineering in 2008.\nResearch interests\n 3D imaging 3D vision Surface measurement Optical sensor design Vision/inspection Biomedical sensors/systems Intelligent assistive devices Wearable robotics Prosthetics Orthotics Machine intelligence & robotics Human-machine interfaces Human-robot interaction Pattern analysis computer vision Signal & image processing Biomechatronics Robotics Operational Artificial Intelligence \n3D imaging\n3D vision\nSurface measurement\nOptical sensor design\nVision/inspection\nBiomedical sensors/systems\nIntelligent assistive devices\nWearable robotics\nProsthetics\nOrthotics\nMachine intelligence & robotics\nHuman-machine interfaces\nHuman-robot interaction\nPattern analysis\ncomputer vision\nSignal & image processing\nBiomechatronics\nRobotics\nOperational Artificial Intelligence\nCourses*\n BME 181 -

Her research interests are focused on the development of subglacial hydrological networks and the impact of this on ice dynamics on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. She analyses these systems using a combination of numerical modelling methods and data integration. Key areas of graduate supervision: Numerical modeling, glacial hydrology, ice dynamics, glaciology data collection. Research interests: My research interests center in glacial hydrology and ice dynamics. In particular, I use numerical models of subglacial water flow combined with remote sensing and in situ data to determine the impact of hydrological development underneath ice sheets and valley glaciers on ice flow. My current research has three primary themes: Using numerical models to assess stability of subglacial lakes in the Antarctic and their impact on the dynamics of fast-flowing ice streams. These large bodies of water accumulate and drain under the ice on scales of years to decades. I am also interested in the seasonal development of Greenland subglacial hydrological networks, particularly in regions of inland ice where the warming climate is allowing greater access of water to the bed of the ice sheet. Field-based data collection from surge-type glaciers in the Yukon. I go to my Yukon field sites several times a year and collect data from dGPS networks, time-lapse cameras and in situ hot water borehole drilling. These data are being applied to analysis of surging glacier dynamics and also hydrological modeling. Geophysical analysis of ice shelf stability in the Antarctic. I use aerial and ground-based geophysical data, along with remote sensing and modeling approaches to assess controls on ice shelf stability, which controls the rate of grounded Antarctic ice flow into the ocean, and therefore sea level rise. Cumulatively, these research interests aim to answer questions about the future of glaciers and ice sheets in our changing climate and contribute to predictions of ice-climate feedbacks. Potential graduate student projects: I welcome inquiries from students interested pursuing a Masters or PhD in glacial dynamics. Current PhD topics include, but are not limited to: Investigation of surging glacier dynamics in the Yukon Territory Supraglacial hydrology modeling on ice sheets and valley glaciers Assessing ice dynamic controls on fractures forming in Antarctic ice shelves Modelling the impact of basal hydrology on grounding line stability in the Antarctic Testing the applicability of subglacial hydrology equations using in situ data Assessing subglacial sediment characteristics from glaciers in the Yukon Territory Please contact me if you would like to discuss these projects or other potential avenues of research.

Her research interests are focused on the development of subglacial hydrological networks and the impact of this on ice dynamics on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. She analyses these systems using a combination of numerical modelling methods and data integration. Key areas of graduate supervision: Numerical modeling, glacial hydrology, ice dynamics, glaciology data collection. Research interests: My research interests center in glacial hydrology and ice dynamics. In particular, I use numerical models of subglacial water flow combined with remote sensing and in situ data to determine the impact of hydrological development underneath ice sheets and valley glaciers on ice flow. My current research has three primary themes: Using numerical models to assess stability of subglacial lakes in the Antarctic and their impact on the dynamics of fast-flowing ice streams. These large bodies of water accumulate and drain under the ice on scales of years to decades. I am also interested in the seasonal development of Greenland subglacial hydrological networks, particularly in regions of inland ice where the warming climate is allowing greater access of water to the bed of the ice sheet. Field-based data collection from surge-type glaciers in the Yukon. I go to my Yukon field sites several times a year and collect data from dGPS networks, time-lapse cameras and in situ hot water borehole drilling. These data are being applied to analysis of surging glacier dynamics and also hydrological modeling. Geophysical analysis of ice shelf stability in the Antarctic. I use aerial and ground-based geophysical data, along with remote sensing and modeling approaches to assess controls on ice shelf stability, which controls the rate of grounded Antarctic ice flow into the ocean, and therefore sea level rise. Cumulatively, these research interests aim to answer questions about the future of glaciers and ice sheets in our changing climate and contribute to predictions of ice-climate feedbacks. Potential graduate student projects: I welcome inquiries from students interested pursuing a Masters or PhD in glacial dynamics. Current PhD topics include, but are not limited to: Investigation of surging glacier dynamics in the Yukon Territory Supraglacial hydrology modeling on ice sheets and valley glaciers Assessing ice dynamic controls on fractures forming in Antarctic ice shelves Modelling the impact of basal hydrology on grounding line stability in the Antarctic Testing the applicability of subglacial hydrology equations using in situ data Assessing subglacial sediment characteristics from glaciers in the Yukon Territory Please contact me if you would like to discuss these projects or other potential avenues of research.

Her research interests are focused on the development of subglacial hydrological networks and the impact of this on ice dynamics on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. She analyses these systems using a combination of numerical modelling methods and data integration. Key areas of graduate supervision: Numerical modeling, glacial hydrology, ice dynamics, glaciology data collection. Research interests: My research interests center in glacial hydrology and ice dynamics. In particular, I use numerical models of subglacial water flow combined with remote sensing and in situ data to determine the impact of hydrological development underneath ice sheets and valley glaciers on ice flow. My current research has three primary themes: Using numerical models to assess stability of subglacial lakes in the Antarctic and their impact on the dynamics of fast-flowing ice streams. These large bodies of water accumulate and drain under the ice on scales of years to decades. I am also interested in the seasonal development of Greenland subglacial hydrological networks, particularly in regions of inland ice where the warming climate is allowing greater access of water to the bed of the ice sheet. Field-based data collection from surge-type glaciers in the Yukon. I go to my Yukon field sites several times a year and collect data from dGPS networks, time-lapse cameras and in situ hot water borehole drilling. These data are being applied to analysis of surging glacier dynamics and also hydrological modeling. Geophysical analysis of ice shelf stability in the Antarctic. I use aerial and ground-based geophysical data, along with remote sensing and modeling approaches to assess controls on ice shelf stability, which controls the rate of grounded Antarctic ice flow into the ocean, and therefore sea level rise. Cumulatively, these research interests aim to answer questions about the future of glaciers and ice sheets in our changing climate and contribute to predictions of ice-climate feedbacks. Potential graduate student projects: I welcome inquiries from students interested pursuing a Masters or PhD in glacial dynamics.

In particular, I use numerical models of subglacial water flow combined with remote sensing and in situ data to determine the impact of hydrological development underneath ice sheets and valley glaciers on ice flow.\nMy current research has three primary themes:\nUsing numerical models to assess stability of subglacial lakes in the Antarctic and their impact on the dynamics of fast-flowing ice streams. These large bodies of water accumulate and drain under the ice on scales of years to decades. I am also interested in the seasonal development of Greenland subglacial hydrological networks, particularly in regions of inland ice where the warming climate is allowing greater access of water to the bed of the ice sheet. Field-based data collection from surge-type glaciers in the Yukon. I go to my Yukon field sites several times a year and collect data from dGPS networks, time-lapse cameras and in situ hot water borehole drilling. These data are being applied to analysis of surging glacier dynamics and also hydrological modeling. Geophysical analysis of ice shelf stability in the Antarctic. I use aerial and ground-based geophysical data, along with remote sensing and modeling approaches to assess controls on ice shelf stability, which controls the rate of grounded Antarctic ice flow into the ocean, and therefore sea level rise. \nUsing numerical models to assess stability of subglacial lakes in the Antarctic and their impact on the dynamics of fast-flowing ice streams.

Research Interests My main research interests aim to improve the retrievals of physical components of the Cryosphere, including permafrost (active layer thickness, timing of thaw/refreeze) and ice parameters in sub-Arctic and Arctic environments. My research applies emerging technologies including: airborne/spaceborne synthetic aperture radar, high-performance cloud computing (ex. Google Earth Engine), interferometry, polarimetric decomposition, thermodynamic modeling, and the collection of field variables to validate these remote observations. I am currently interested in the application of these methods in tundra and boreal regions where small lakes and ponds are numerous providing significant ecosystem services to local communities through fishery/game habitat and winter transportation corridors. I approach research questions incorporating field observations and modeling efforts to improve the understanding of the interaction of microwaves with physical features of the lake system, thereby providing the ability to retrieve and monitor permafrost and ice properties, furthering the ability to assess how the frozen regime will change in the future.

Research Interests My main research interests aim to improve the retrievals of physical components of the Cryosphere, including permafrost (active layer thickness, timing of thaw/refreeze) and ice parameters in sub-Arctic and Arctic environments. My research applies emerging technologies including: airborne/spaceborne synthetic aperture radar, high-performance cloud computing (ex. Google Earth Engine), interferometry, polarimetric decomposition, thermodynamic modeling, and the collection of field variables to validate these remote observations. I am currently interested in the application of these methods in tundra and boreal regions where small lakes and ponds are numerous providing significant ecosystem services to local communities through fishery/game habitat and winter transportation corridors. I approach research questions incorporating field observations and modeling efforts to improve the understanding of the interaction of microwaves with physical features of the lake system, thereby providing the ability to retrieve and monitor permafrost and ice properties, furthering the ability to assess how the frozen regime will change in the future.

For more information, visit Peter Johnson's research team website. Key Areas of Graduate Supervision The Geoweb, open data, mobile technology, public participation GIS, community-based geomatics, geospatial technology in planning and government. Note: Peter is recruiting new graduate students, particularly PhD students, with interests and experience working in open data, smart cities, and technology adoption. Please contact Peter directly for more information. Recent Courses Taught GEOG 187: Problem Solving in Geomatics GEOG 381: Spatial Analysis Using Geographic Information Systems GEOG 483/683: The Geoweb and Location-Based Services Research Interests My research seeks to understand how governments, citizens, and private companies share information through geospatial technology, including open data, the geoweb, social media, mobile devices, and the process of crowdsourcing. As location-based technology untethers communications from the traditional spaces of home, work, and play, there is a vital need for critical reflection. My research evaluates the affordances that geospatial technology creates for communications and information sharing, identifying emergent adoption challenges and constraints.

His research involves understanding the complex multi-phase flows and transport phenomena that regulate how CO2 behaves in the porous subsurface. Professor Leonenko has a joint appointment with the Department of Geography and Environmental Management. Research Interests Complex multi-phase flows and transport phenomena Geological storage of CO2 and climate control Emerging technologies of petroleum and energy production Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Climate Change and Geosciences Scholarly Research Professor Leonenko focuses on the development of Climate Control technologies with an emphasis on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Industrial scale CO2 storage projects, now operational or in the design phase, provide strong empirical support for the view that CO2 storage can be implemented safely. Nevertheless, significant uncertainties remain regarding the security of underground storage at the scales necessary for this technology to play a significant role in managing global emissions. A critical issue for geological storage is to ensure that the stored CO2 does not escape from the underground formations. Current research interests are in the area of development of new approaches and technologies to mitigate the risks of CO2 leakage (along with other risks) to make CCS more feasible to implement. Modeling and numerical simulation of multiphase flow in porous media, fractures and faults; interactions between CO2 and reservoir fluids; novel technologies for in situ and ex situ dissolution of CO2, and risk assessments are among the topics of Professor Leonenko\u2019s research. He has played significant role in establishing the Carbon Management Canada (CMC) Center of Excellence with $50 million of government funding. He is also actively involved in the development and promotion of Carbon Capture and Storage technologies, including the Shell Sequestration Project and the Wabamun Lake CO2 Sequestration Project (Phase-I, preliminary research). This research has led to more than $1 billion in commercial developments.

His research involves understanding the complex multi-phase flows and transport phenomena that regulate how CO2 behaves in the porous subsurface. Professor Leonenko has a joint appointment with the Department of Geography and Environmental Management.\n\n\nResearch Interests\n Complex multi-phase flows and transport phenomena Geological storage of CO2 and climate control Emerging technologies of petroleum and energy production Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Climate Change and Geosciences \n Complex multi-phase flows and transport phenomena Geological storage of CO2 and climate control Emerging technologies of petroleum and energy production Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Climate Change and Geosciences \nComplex multi-phase flows and transport phenomena\nGeological storage of CO2 and climate control\nEmerging technologies of petroleum and energy production\nCarbon Dioxide Capture and Storage\nClimate Change and Geosciences\nScholarly Research\n Professor Leonenko focuses on the development of Climate Control technologies with an emphasis on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Industrial scale CO2 storage projects, now operational or in the design phase, provide strong empirical support for the view that CO2 storage can be implemented safely. Nevertheless, significant uncertainties remain regarding the security of underground storage at the scales necessary for this technology to play a significant role in managing global emissions. A critical issue for geological storage is to ensure that the stored CO2 does not escape from the underground formations. Current research interests are in the area of development of new approaches and technologies to mitigate the risks of CO2 leakage (along with other risks) to make CCS more feasible to implement. Modeling and numerical simulation of multiphase flow in porous media, fractures and faults; interactions between CO2 and reservoir fluids; novel technologies for in situ and ex situ dissolution of CO2, and risk assessments are among the topics of Professor Leonenko\u2019s research. He has played significant role in establishing the Carbon Management Canada (CMC) Center of Excellence with $50 million of government funding. He is also actively involved in the development and promotion of Carbon Capture and Storage technologies, including the Shell Sequestration Project and the Wabamun Lake CO2 Sequestration Project (Phase-I, preliminary research). This research has led to more than $1 billion in commercial developments. \nEducation\n 1991 PhD Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics, Institute of Thermophysics, Russian Academy of Science, Novosibirsk, Russia 1985 MSc Physics, Novosibirsk State University, Russia \n 1991 PhD Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics, Institute of Thermophysics, Russian Academy of Science, Novosibirsk, Russia 1985 MSc Physics, Novosibirsk State University, Russia \n1991 PhD Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics, Institute of Thermophysics, Russian Academy of Science, Novosibirsk, Russia \n1985 MSc Physics, Novosibirsk State University, Russia\nAwards\n 1997 European Academy Award to Young Scientists, Achievements in Investigation of Critical Phenomena 1996 Russian Academy of Science Award, Research achievements in Thermophysics and Hydrodynamics \n 1997 European Academy Award to Young Scientists, Achievements in Investigation of Critical Phenomena 1996 Russian Academy of Science Award, Research achievements in Thermophysics and Hydrodynamics \n1997 European Academy Award to Young Scientists, Achievements in Investigation of Critical Phenomena\n1996 Russian Academy of Science Award, Research achievements in Thermophysics and Hydrodynamics\nService\n GHG (Green House Gas) Representative for UW Associate Membership in COSIA (Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance) \n GHG (Green House Gas) Representative for UW Associate Membership in COSIA (Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance) \nGHG (Green House Gas) Representative for UW Associate Membership in COSIA (Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance)\nAffiliations and Volunteer Work\n Cross appointed with the Department of Geography and Environmental Management \n Cross appointed with the Department of Geography and Environmental Management \nCross appointed with the Department of Geography and Environmental Management\nTeaching*\n CIVE 497 - Special Topics in Civil Engineering Taught in 2019, 2020 EARTH 491 - Special Topics in Earth and Environmental Sciences Taught in 2019 GEOG 309 - Physical Climatology Taught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 SCI 201 - Global Warming and Climate Change Taught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 * Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed. \n CIVE 497 - Special Topics in Civil Engineering Taught in 2019, 2020 EARTH 491 - Special Topics in Earth and Environmental Sciences Taught in 2019 GEOG 309 - Physical Climatology Taught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 SCI 201 - Global Warming and Climate Change Taught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 \nCIVE 497 - Special Topics in Civil Engineering Taught in 2019, 2020 \n Taught in 2019, 2020 \nTaught in 2019, 2020\nEARTH 491 - Special Topics in Earth and Environmental Sciences Taught in 2019 \n Taught in 2019 \nTaught in 2019\nGEOG 309 - Physical Climatology Taught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 \n Taught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 \nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\nSCI 201 - Global Warming and Climate Change Taught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 \n Taught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 \nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\nSelected/Recent Publications\n Professor Leonenko has published in high ranked journals such as Chemical Engineering Journal, Energy and Fuels, Environmental Science and Technology, International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Chemical Engineering Science, Chemical Engineering and Technology, and Langmuir.

Types of hydrologic change include those that result from land-use modification (e.g. agriculture, drainage) or climate variability. Her work largely involves both field and laboratory research, and her study areas have included sites in Ontario, eastern Quebec, northern Alberta, and northern Manitoba. She is interested in how nutrient supply and transport processes interact to control nutrient fluxes, and, how such interactions change with climate variability or anthropogenic disturbance. In agricultural systems, she is currently investigating year-round phosphorus losses in tile drain effluent and how these losses are affected by tillage practices. She is also investigating both hydrological and biogeochemical processes in northern peatlands, and how these processes may change under a warmer climate.

Key Areas of Graduate Supervision biogeochemistry, hydrology, wetland science, agricultural water quality, agricultural tile drainage, nutrients Recent Courses Taught GEOG 407: Environmental Hydrology GEOG 640: Seminar in Physical Geography GEOG 675: Applied Biogeochemistry Research Interests Dr. Macrae\u2019s research interests center around the effects of changing hydrologic conditions on biogeochemical processes (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus) in both natural and disturbed environments. Types of hydrologic change include those that result from land-use modification (e.g. agriculture, drainage) or climate variability. Her work largely involves both field and laboratory research, and her study areas have included sites in Ontario, eastern Quebec, northern Alberta, and northern Manitoba. She is interested in how nutrient supply and transport processes interact to control nutrient fluxes, and, how such interactions change with climate variability or anthropogenic disturbance. In agricultural systems, she is currently investigating year-round phosphorus losses in tile drain effluent and how these losses are affected by tillage practices. She is also investigating both hydrological and biogeochemical processes in northern peatlands, and how these processes may change under a warmer climate.

Key areas of Graduate Supervision: wildlife ecology, spatial and landscape ecology, conservation biology, ecohydrology, habitat restoration, herpetology Recent Courses Taught ENVS 278: Applied Statistics for Environmental Research Research Interests The goal of Chantel\u2019s interdisciplinary research program is to advance our knowledge and understanding of the spatiotemporal effects of climate change disturbances (e.g., wildfire, drought, weather whiplash) on the resilience and vulnerability of threatened wildlife and their habitats. This collaborative research supports evidence-based policies for the conservation and management of healthy reptile populations and habitat. Three main research themes include: Effects of climate-mediated disturbances on habitat use and function. Climate change disturbances such as wildfire, drought, and weather whiplash events are increasing in frequency and severity. The effects of these climate-mediated disturbances on habitat function have consequences for the long-term persistence of vulnerable ecosystems (e.g., wetlands) and threatened wildlife (e.g., reptiles) that rely on these habitats. It is critical to understand how multiple stressors effect habitat function to support data-driven wildlife management and habitat restoration strategies in a changing climate. Learn more about this research here. Climate refugia: Detecting and predicting change. Identifying ecosystems resilient to climate change is recognized as essential for conservation strategies. However, wetland ecosystems may respond differently to stressors depending on the strength of ecohydrological feedbacks, resulting in fluctuations in habitat availability and suitability. Therefore, our ability to detect and predict spatiotemporal changes in climate refugia will be instrumental in guiding management decisions and informing policy. Learn more about this research here. Habitat restoration: enhancing resilience to climate change. In an era of unprecedented change, habitat restoration techniques can be used to enhance habitat resilience to climate change. Weather conditions and lack of organic soil are current limitations to habitat restoration and creation in rock barrens landscapes. Through collaborative research, I aim to create innovative, interdisciplinary restoration approaches to restore habitat conditions to ensure reptile population persistence.

Key areas of Graduate Supervision: wildlife ecology, spatial and landscape ecology, conservation biology, ecohydrology, habitat restoration, herpetology Recent Courses Taught ENVS 278: Applied Statistics for Environmental Research Research Interests The goal of Chantel\u2019s interdisciplinary research program is to advance our knowledge and understanding of the spatiotemporal effects of climate change disturbances (e.g., wildfire, drought, weather whiplash) on the resilience and vulnerability of threatened wildlife and their habitats. This collaborative research supports evidence-based policies for the conservation and management of healthy reptile populations and habitat. Three main research themes include: Effects of climate-mediated disturbances on habitat use and function. Climate change disturbances such as wildfire, drought, and weather whiplash events are increasing in frequency and severity. The effects of these climate-mediated disturbances on habitat function have consequences for the long-term persistence of vulnerable ecosystems (e.g., wetlands) and threatened wildlife (e.g., reptiles) that rely on these habitats. It is critical to understand how multiple stressors effect habitat function to support data-driven wildlife management and habitat restoration strategies in a changing climate. Learn more about this research here. Climate refugia: Detecting and predicting change. Identifying ecosystems resilient to climate change is recognized as essential for conservation strategies. However, wetland ecosystems may respond differently to stressors depending on the strength of ecohydrological feedbacks, resulting in fluctuations in habitat availability and suitability. Therefore, our ability to detect and predict spatiotemporal changes in climate refugia will be instrumental in guiding management decisions and informing policy. Learn more about this research here. Habitat restoration: enhancing resilience to climate change. In an era of unprecedented change, habitat restoration techniques can be used to enhance habitat resilience to climate change. Weather conditions and lack of organic soil are current limitations to habitat restoration and creation in rock barrens landscapes. Through collaborative research, I aim to create innovative, interdisciplinary restoration approaches to restore habitat conditions to ensure reptile population persistence.

My name is Matt. I'm a Lecturer in the Department of Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I have researched musical instrument design and construction during my PhD; taught my students how to build electronic musical interfaces; and co-founded the Waterloo Tape Music Club, a collaborative space for exploring new music. My work has always spanned across disciplines, with many artistic collaborations and projects over the years. These days I don't know what I'm doing. I feel upside down. The things I feel we need, more than anything, are good relationships. With each other, with our students, with the people that run this university, with this Land and our Indigenous hosts here in Ontario, with the animals and the water and the trees, with the people and places our work is connected to around the entire planet. We need to reconnect the web of relationality that the past few years has torn holes in. We need to understand that acting accountably, and in good relationship, makes you feel good! We don't need to be saviours or leaders; we need to be good neighbours and friends. We need to build consensus and community. We need to understand that we should be working for the good of this place as a whole, not just for ourselves, or our unit. This will take time. It will be hard and require us to put others before ourselves. We will need to listen to each other, deeply, and with an open heart. Let's do it together. This is the work we need to do. Let's start!

He is also a co-director of the Vision and Imaging Processing Lab and the director of the Statistical Image Processing Lab at the University of Waterloo. His undergraduate studies were in Engineering at the University of Waterloo, and his graduate studies were in Engineering at MIT. Research Interests Signal and Image Processing Societal and Environmental Systems Statistical Modeling Multiscale Methods Remote Sensing Computer Vision Pattern Analysis Machine Learning Scholarly Research His main areas of research lie in multiscale statistical modelling and machine learning. In particular, Professor Fieguth concentrates on the theory development and understanding of hierarchical/scale recursive estimation algorithms for multi-resolution stochastic processes. Such algorithms use a statistically meaningful strategy to break large estimation problems into smaller pieces, leading to vast improvements in efficiency. His particular passion focuses on complex systems (that is, nonlinear dynamic systems and the consequences of such systems). He has a Springer textbook on this subject, and is always happy to hear about new, motivating, multi-disciplinary examples that could bring a deeper understanding of complex systems. Industrial Research He has been involved in a large number of industry projects, very briefly: - Projector-Camera systems, calibration, 3D inference - Video analysis and modeling - Analysis of ultrasound data, particularly for diabetic patients - Analysis of high-speed video data for fusion-energy applications - Analysis of additive manufacturing, particularly laser-sintering processes - Automated methods for melanoma detection and screening - Analysis and 3D inference from underwater video - Analysis of traffic video to assess intersection safety Education 1995, Doctorate PhD, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States 1993, SM, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States 1991, Bachelor's BASc, University of Waterloo, Ontario Awards 2019 Distinguished Teaching Award, University of Waterloo 2015 Award of Excellence in Graduate Supervision, University of Waterloo 2011 IEEE Senior Member 2018 Faculty of Engineering Outstanding Performance Award University of Waterloo 2014 Faculty of Engineering Distinguished Performance Award University of Waterloo 2001 Sanford Fleming Foundation Teaching Award, University of Waterloo Service 2023-Present.

He is also a co-director of the Vision and Imaging Processing Lab and the director of the Statistical Image Processing Lab at the University of Waterloo. His undergraduate studies were in Engineering at the University of Waterloo, and his graduate studies were in Engineering at MIT. \nVision and Imaging Processing Lab\nStatistical Image Processing Lab\n\n\nResearch Interests\n Signal and Image Processing Societal and Environmental Systems Statistical Modeling Multiscale Methods Remote Sensing Computer Vision Pattern Analysis Machine Learning \n Signal and Image Processing Societal and Environmental Systems Statistical Modeling Multiscale Methods Remote Sensing Computer Vision Pattern Analysis Machine Learning \nSignal and Image Processing\nSocietal and Environmental Systems\nStatistical Modeling\nMultiscale Methods\nRemote Sensing\nComputer Vision\nPattern Analysis\nMachine Learning\nScholarly Research\n His main areas of research lie in multiscale statistical modelling and machine learning. In particular, Professor Fieguth concentrates on the theory development and understanding of hierarchical/scale recursive estimation algorithms for multi-resolution stochastic processes. Such algorithms use a statistically meaningful strategy to break large estimation problems into smaller pieces, leading to vast improvements in efficiency. His particular passion focuses on complex systems (that is, nonlinear dynamic systems and the consequences of such systems). He has a Springer textbook on this subject, and is always happy to hear about new, motivating, multi-disciplinary examples that could bring a deeper understanding of complex systems. \nIndustrial Research\n He has been involved in a large number of industry projects, very briefly: - Projector-Camera systems, calibration, 3D inference - Video analysis and modeling - Analysis of ultrasound data, particularly for diabetic patients - Analysis of high-speed video data for fusion-energy applications - Analysis of additive manufacturing, particularly laser-sintering processes - Automated methods for melanoma detection and screening - Analysis and 3D inference from underwater video - Analysis of traffic video to assess intersection safety \nEducation\n 1995, Doctorate PhD, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States 1993, SM, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States 1991, Bachelor's BASc, University of Waterloo, Ontario \n 1995, Doctorate PhD, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States 1993, SM, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States 1991, Bachelor's BASc, University of Waterloo, Ontario \n1995, Doctorate PhD, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States\n1993, SM, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States\n1991, Bachelor's BASc, University of Waterloo, Ontario\nAwards\n 2019 Distinguished Teaching Award, University of Waterloo 2015 Award of Excellence in Graduate Supervision, University of Waterloo 2011 IEEE Senior Member 2018 Faculty of Engineering Outstanding Performance Award University of Waterloo 2014 Faculty of Engineering Distinguished Performance Award University of Waterloo 2001 Sanford Fleming Foundation Teaching Award, University of Waterloo \n 2019 Distinguished Teaching Award, University of Waterloo 2015 Award of Excellence in Graduate Supervision, University of Waterloo 2011 IEEE Senior Member 2018 Faculty of Engineering Outstanding Performance Award University of Waterloo 2014 Faculty of Engineering Distinguished Performance Award University of Waterloo 2001 Sanford Fleming Foundation Teaching Award, University of Waterloo \n2019 Distinguished Teaching Award, University of Waterloo\n2015 Award of Excellence in Graduate Supervision, University of Waterloo\n2011 IEEE Senior Member\n2018 Faculty of Engineering Outstanding Performance Award University of Waterloo\n2014 Faculty of Engineering Distinguished Performance Award University of Waterloo\n2001 Sanford Fleming Foundation Teaching Award, University of Waterloo\nService\n 2023-Present.

He integrates neurobiological models and deep learning to study visuomotor processes. He is also interested in applying these models in challenging robotics tasks, to better understand how the brain deals with the complex physical world. Recent progress in his lab includes: The first deep-network architecture that is based quantitatively on a large cortical network (Tripp, 2019); the most comprehensive model of a higher cortical representation (Rezai et al., 2018); the largest dataset of human-demonstrated robotic grasps (Iyegar et al., 2018); the only robotic head that has movement capabilities on par with humans (including saccade velocity, stereo baseline, and range of motion) (Huber et al., 2018); and the first spiking neural network model of the planning of complex actions (Blouw et al., 2016). \n \n*** I am starting a new research group in Medical AI and have graduate positions open in that area. ***\nResearch interests\n Computational neuroscience Deep learning Robotics Medical AI \nComputational neuroscience\nDeep learning\nRobotics\nMedical AI\nCourses*\n BIOL 487 - Computational NeuroscienceTaught in 2023 BME 261 - Prototyping, Simulation and DesignTaught in 2020, 2021 BME 355 - Physiological Systems ModellingTaught in 2020, 2021 BME 461 - Biomedical Engineering Design Workshop 2Taught in 2023 BME 462 - Biomedical Engineering Design Workshop 3Taught in 2024 SYDE 113 - Elementary Engineering MathematicsTaught in 2019 SYDE 121 - Digital ComputationTaught in 2020 SYDE 552 - Computational NeuroscienceTaught in 2023 SYDE 599 - Special Topics in Systems Design EngineeringTaught in 2022, 2023 \nBIOL 487 - Computational NeuroscienceTaught in 2023\nTaught in 2023\nTaught in 2023\nBME 261 - Prototyping, Simulation and DesignTaught in 2020, 2021\nTaught in 2020, 2021\nTaught in 2020, 2021\nBME 355 - Physiological Systems ModellingTaught in 2020, 2021\nTaught in 2020, 2021\nTaught in 2020, 2021\nBME 461 - Biomedical Engineering Design Workshop 2Taught in 2023\nTaught in 2023\nTaught in 2023\nBME 462 - Biomedical Engineering Design Workshop 3Taught in 2024\nTaught in 2024\nTaught in 2024\nSYDE 113 - Elementary Engineering MathematicsTaught in 2019\nTaught in 2019\nTaught in 2019\nSYDE 121 - Digital ComputationTaught in 2020\nTaught in 2020\nTaught in 2020\nSYDE 552 - Computational NeuroscienceTaught in 2023\nTaught in 2023\nTaught in 2023\nSYDE 599 - Special Topics in Systems Design EngineeringTaught in 2022, 2023\nTaught in 2022, 2023\nTaught in 2022, 2023\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\nSelected/recent publications\n Tripp, BP, Approximating the Architecture of Visual Cortex in a Convolutional Network, Neural Computation, 31(8), 2019, 1551 - 1591Link Omid Rezai, Pinar Boyraz Jentsch, Bryan Tripp, A video-driven model of response statistics in the primate middle temporal area, Neural Networks, 108, 2018, 424 - 444Link Huber, Scott and Selby, Ben and Tripp, Bryan, OREO: An open-hardware robotic head that supports practical saccades and accommodation,, IEEE Robotics Automation Letters, 3(3), 2018, 2640 - 2645Link Selby, Ben and Tripp, Bryan, Extending the Stabilized Supralinear Network model of V1 for binocular image processing, 2017, Neural Networks 90: 29-41.

Professor Savage\u2019s research aims to produce general models of spatially continuous processes such as heat conduction, diffusion, and elasticity. These models provide conceptual or computational advantages, which unify or categorize existing numerical methods such as finite elements and finite differences. \nProfessor Savage\u2019s research focuses on the areas of non-linear media modelling, coupled fields, probabilistic boundary conditions and constitutive properties; flexibility and impedance finite elements; and grid optimization methods. \nAnother area of his research is reliability and quality of design, which is in response to the increasing importance of safety and quality objectives as more complex systems are being designed and environmental standards are becoming stricter. The concepts of reliability and quality have proven to be useful in helping quantify constraints and selective alternative designs. \nProfessor Savage\u2019s research aims to provide a unified methodology for the design of various physical systems that encompass both quality and safety design criteria. The methodology is applicable to multi-disciplinary systems and incorporates several mathematical theories of probability assessment. The research results should provide a design methodology well suited, but not restricted to, the design of systems with active redundancy and dependent component failures. Additionally, it should provide important measures that can be used for the comparison and improvement of designs.\nResearch interests\n Modeling & Simulation reliability and quality in design Systems Theory & Optimization Discrete Continuum Theories Mechatronics Design Large Systems Modelling through Subsystems Modelling and Optimization of Systems Pattern Analysis Machine Intelligence & Robotics \nModeling & Simulation\nreliability and quality in design\nSystems Theory & Optimization\nDiscrete Continuum Theories\nMechatronics Design\nLarge Systems Modelling through Subsystems\nModelling and Optimization of Systems\nPattern Analysis\nMachine Intelligence & Robotics\nEducation\n 1976, Doctorate, PhD, University of Waterloo 1970, Master's, MASc, University of Waterloo 1968, Bachelor's, BASc, University of Waterloo \n 1976, Doctorate, PhD, University of Waterloo \n 1970, Master's, MASc, University of Waterloo \n 1968, Bachelor's, BASc, University of Waterloo \nCourses*\n SYDE 252 - Linear Systems and SignalsTaught in 2020, 2021, 2022 SYDE 351 - Systems Models 1Taught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 SYDE 352 - Introduction to Control SystemsTaught in 2022 SYDE 661 - Model-Based Robust DesignTaught in 2019, 2020, 2022 \nSYDE 252 - Linear Systems and SignalsTaught in 2020, 2021, 2022\nTaught in 2020, 2021, 2022\nTaught in 2020, 2021, 2022\nSYDE 351 - Systems Models 1Taught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022\nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022\nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022\nSYDE 352 - Introduction to Control SystemsTaught in 2022\nTaught in 2022\nTaught in 2022\nSYDE 661 - Model-Based Robust DesignTaught in 2019, 2020, 2022\nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2022\nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2022\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\nSelected/recent publications\n Savage, Gordon J and Son, Young Kap, An Extreme-Value Event Approach for Frequency-Domain Performance Reliability, IEEE Transactions on Reliability, 65(2), 2016, 1058 - 1068 Savage, Gordon J and Zhang, Xufang and Son, Young Kap and Pandey, Mahesh D, Reliability of mechanisms with periodic random modal frequencies using an extreme value-based approach, Reliability Engineering & System Safety, 150, 2016, 65 - 77 LI, QIUYANG and SAVAGE, GORDON J and SON, YOUNG KAP, Economic, Robust and Quality Design of Engineering Systems using a Hybrid Six Sigma-second Moment Approach., International Journal of Performability Engineering, 11(4), 2015 Son, Young Kap and Savage, Gordon J, Stability Analysis of Uncertain Systems Using a Singular Value Decomposition-Based Metric, International Journal of Reliability, Quality and Safety Engineering, 22(05), 2015 Wang, Shujuan and Li, Qiuyang and Savage, Gordon J, Reliability-based robust design optimization of structures considering uncertainty in design variables, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2015, 2015 \nSavage, Gordon J and Son, Young Kap, An Extreme-Value Event Approach for Frequency-Domain Performance Reliability, IEEE Transactions on Reliability, 65(2), 2016, 1058 - 1068\n\nSavage, Gordon J and Zhang, Xufang and Son, Young Kap and Pandey, Mahesh D, Reliability of mechanisms with periodic random modal frequencies using an extreme value-based approach, Reliability Engineering & System Safety, 150, 2016, 65 - 77\n\nLI, QIUYANG and SAVAGE, GORDON J and SON, YOUNG KAP, Economic, Robust and Quality Design of Engineering Systems using a Hybrid Six Sigma-second Moment Approach., International Journal of Performability Engineering, 11(4), 2015\n\nSon, Young Kap and Savage, Gordon J, Stability Analysis of Uncertain Systems Using a Singular Value Decomposition-Based Metric, International Journal of Reliability, Quality and Safety Engineering, 22(05), 2015\n\nWang, Shujuan and Li, Qiuyang and Savage, Gordon J, Reliability-based robust design optimization of structures considering uncertainty in design variables, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2015, 2015\n\nGraduate studies\n Currently considering applications from graduate students.

She is particularly interested in how elastomers and soft biological tissues behave at nano-, micro-, macro- levels; and how this knowledge can be used to advance scientific progress. Professor Sigaeva is actively involved in several biomechanics and biomimetics related projects. One of her main research principles is that theory, simulations, and experiments are complementary, not competitive approaches as such Tais utilizes all three in her research. Finally, she strongly believes in effective multidisciplinary and collaborative practices in order to achieve success in research. \n \nProfessor Sigaeva\u2019s specific research interests are: \n \n1. Mechanical testing and constitutive modelling of soft biological tissues, coupling of mechanical testing devices with microscopy to observe deformation of load-bearing fiber components. \n \n2. Quantification of intra- and inter-patient variability in soft biological tissues. \n \n3. Modelling of buckling phenomena in elastomers and soft biological tissues. \n \n4. Universal solution of nonlinear elasticity and their application to biomechanical problems. \n \n5. Tunable behavior of elastomeric structures. \n \nTarget materials: \n \nHealthy and wounded skin, healthy aortas and aneurysms, aortic valves, engineered tissues and elastomeric materials.\nResearch interests\n soft tissue nonlinear elasticity continuum mechanics mechanical testing uniaxial testing biaxial testing residual stress data analysis constitutive modelling cardiovascular mechanics fibrous micro-structure multiphoton microscopy heterogeneity anisotropy layers aneurysms skin \nsoft tissue\nnonlinear elasticity\ncontinuum mechanics\nmechanical testing\nuniaxial testing\nbiaxial testing\nresidual stress\ndata analysis\nconstitutive modelling\ncardiovascular mechanics\nfibrous micro-structure\nmultiphoton microscopy\nheterogeneity\nanisotropy\nlayers\naneurysms\nskin\nEducation\n 2015, Doctorate, Mechnical Engineering, University of Alberta 2011, Specialist (B.Sc. equiv), Mechanics, Southern Federal University \n 2015, Doctorate, Mechnical Engineering, University of Alberta \n 2011, Specialist (B.Sc. equiv), Mechanics, Southern Federal University \nCourses*\n BME 182 - Physics 2: DynamicsTaught in 2021 SYDE 182 - Physics 2: DynamicsTaught in 2021, 2022, 2023 SYDE 553 - Advanced DynamicsTaught in 2022 \nBME 182 - Physics 2: DynamicsTaught in 2021\nTaught in 2021\nTaught in 2021\nSYDE 182 - Physics 2: DynamicsTaught in 2021, 2022, 2023\nTaught in 2021, 2022, 2023\nTaught in 2021, 2022, 2023\nSYDE 553 - Advanced DynamicsTaught in 2022\nTaught in 2022\nTaught in 2022\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\nSelected/recent publications\n Sigaeva T., Fiori C., Pino Alban M., Beauferris Y., Stagg D., Beddoes R., Di Martino E.S. ``Hands-on, minds-on & science-up'': a concept-based learning laboratory with a taste of research experience for an undergraduate biomedical engineering course.
