While we can influence the speed and magnitude of anthropogenically induced climate change, we cannot avoid it altogether. Human responses to actual and anticipated climate change, collectively known as adaptation, require considerations of uncertainty, equity, effectiveness and cost. My research focuses on a) community-level vulnerability assessment in light of climate change and other stresses in various economic sectors and geographic contexts; and b) pro-active adaptation planning to reduce anticipated vulnerability. \n Research Interests\n\n Recent Publications \n Recent Publications\n Crick, F., J.

For many millennials, especially those who entered the workforce after the economic crisis of 2008-2009, uncertainty and flexibility in working life is an expected norm. Rather than focus solely the economic consequences of freelancing, Home/work contends that it is critical to think beyond paid work to fully capture understanding of the lives of millennial freelancers. As young adults work hard to build their chosen careers, issues of social reproduction (especially childcare and unpaid work at home) become pressing concerns. Social reproduction is what allows the economy to function, so it is vital to connect paid/unpaid forms of labour to fully understand millennial freelancers\u2019 working lives. While we know that freelancing is a growing sector of the labour market, there is less understanding about the wider consequences of this change, including why millennials become freelancers, how they make sense of this form of labour\u2014is it flexible, precarious or both, and how they manage freelancing with other forms of work at home. https://home-work.ca/ Previous project: GenY at Home: Well-being, Autonomy and Co-Residence with Parents SSHRC Insight Development grant (2015-2017) Anecdotally we know that some young Canadians (those in their twenties through early 30s) say they have not achieved financial independence from parents. We also know that young adults are \"boomeranging\" home - that is, living on their own for a while but then returning to the home of their parents or living with in-laws. Ontario has the highest rate of co-residence, where 50% of twenty-somethings in Ontario live with their parents. This pattern is a recent social development in Canada; previous generations left home much earlier and in great numbers. Who is returning home and how do they feel about it? Are parents paying bills or are young adults paying their own way in the family home? Is it as much about care--for aging parents or recent kids--than it is about not finding work? Do young people want to buy their own homes? What are the complex reasons for, and consequences of, living at home?

For many millennials, especially those who entered the workforce after the economic crisis of 2008-2009, uncertainty and flexibility in working life is an expected norm. Rather than focus solely the economic consequences of freelancing, Home/work contends that it is critical to think beyond paid work to fully capture understanding of the lives of millennial freelancers. As young adults work hard to build their chosen careers, issues of social reproduction (especially childcare and unpaid work at home) become pressing concerns. Social reproduction is what allows the economy to function, so it is vital to connect paid/unpaid forms of labour to fully understand millennial freelancers\u2019 working lives. While we know that freelancing is a growing sector of the labour market, there is less understanding about the wider consequences of this change, including why millennials become freelancers, how they make sense of this form of labour\u2014is it flexible, precarious or both, and how they manage freelancing with other forms of work at home. https://home-work.ca/ Previous project: GenY at Home: Well-being, Autonomy and Co-Residence with Parents SSHRC Insight Development grant (2015-2017) Anecdotally we know that some young Canadians (those in their twenties through early 30s) say they have not achieved financial independence from parents. We also know that young adults are \"boomeranging\" home - that is, living on their own for a while but then returning to the home of their parents or living with in-laws. Ontario has the highest rate of co-residence, where 50% of twenty-somethings in Ontario live with their parents. This pattern is a recent social development in Canada; previous generations left home much earlier and in great numbers. Who is returning home and how do they feel about it? Are parents paying bills or are young adults paying their own way in the family home? Is it as much about care--for aging parents or recent kids--than it is about not finding work?

This pattern is a recent social development in Canada; previous generations left home much earlier and in great numbers. Who is returning home and how do they feel about it? Are parents paying bills or are young adults paying their own way in the family home? Is it as much about care--for aging parents or recent kids--than it is about not finding work?

For many millennials, especially those who entered the workforce after the economic crisis of 2008-2009, uncertainty and flexibility in working life is an expected norm. Rather than focus solely the economic consequences of freelancing, Home/work contends that it is critical to think beyond paid work to fully capture understanding of the lives of millennial freelancers. As young adults work hard to build their chosen careers, issues of social reproduction (especially childcare and unpaid work at home) become pressing concerns. Social reproduction is what allows the economy to function, so it is vital to connect paid/unpaid forms of labour to fully understand millennial freelancers\u2019 working lives. While we know that freelancing is a growing sector of the labour market, there is less understanding about the wider consequences of this change, including why millennials become freelancers, how they make sense of this form of labour\u2014is it flexible, precarious or both, and how they manage freelancing with other forms of work at home. https://home-work.ca/ Previous project: GenY at Home: Well-being, Autonomy and Co-Residence with Parents SSHRC Insight Development grant (2015-2017) Anecdotally we know that some young Canadians (those in their twenties through early 30s) say they have not achieved financial independence from parents.

We also know that young adults are \"boomeranging\" home - that is, living on their own for a while but then returning to the home of their parents or living with in-laws. Ontario has the highest rate of co-residence, where 50% of twenty-somethings in Ontario live with their parents. This pattern is a recent social development in Canada; previous generations left home much earlier and in great numbers. Who is returning home and how do they feel about it? Are parents paying bills or are young adults paying their own way in the family home? Is it as much about care--for aging parents or recent kids--than it is about not finding work? Do young people want to buy their own homes? What are the complex reasons for, and consequences of, living at home?

Of particular interest are questions: Does the provision of transit passes provide increased access to recreation, employment and other opportunities? Do students with transit passes experience greater travel independence and, as a result, rely less on chauffeuring by parents and others? If the above holds true, do households experience travel cost savings in terms of both time and money? Application of smart-phones to gather travel behavior in the City of Edmonton Funded by: The City of Edmonton in partnership with R.A. Malatest This research project presents the opportunity to commercialize Ph.D. research conducted at the University of Waterloo. Data \u2013 origin, destination, mode, and path \u2013 were gathered for a large sample of households and travelers in Edmonton to inform the development of a travel forecasting model. The passively collected smart-phone data were used to calibrate and validate information gathered through traditional travel diaries. iCity Urban Informatics for Sustainable Metropolitan Growth Funded by: Ontario Research Foundation (ORF). Grant led by the University of Toronto (Eric Miller) Research aimed at understanding how innovations in travel data collection (both methods and specific information) can better inform decision-making to advance sustainable transportation and cities.Specific questions to be addressed in Waterloo include: How will the investment in Light Rail Transit (LRT) change overall Regional travel patterns? How important will the Region\u2019s Central Transit Corridor (CTC) become for attracting trips? How will travel within the CTC, especially tours, evolve over time as the density and diversity of land uses change? Light Rail and Core Area Intensification \u2013 Unpacking Causal Relationships Funded by: SSHRC (Partnership Development Grant) PI is Dawn Parker, School of Planning Much research has been conducted on the relationship between land use and transportation, particularly the influence of land use investments on density.This research explores these relationships in the Region of Waterloo as a result of the LRT project.This research takes a combined approach to try and demonstrate causality of land use impacts by: Using hedonic pricing techniques to isolate the impacts of proximity to the LRT on land / home values; Interview developers to understand (quantitatively and qualitatively) their perceptions of LRT on market dynamics; Interview home buyers, home sellers, and renters to determine the perceived value of access resulting from LRT. Sustainable Transportation Modeling Funded by: NSERC (Discovery Grant) Research supported significant development of novel data collection and analysis techniques, particularly related to sustain transportation modes \u2013 walking, cycling and transit. Improving transit representation in travel forecasting models Funded by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) The research program develops mathematical methods to represent the dynamic relationship among transit frequency, ridership, and fiscal constraints. The models generated can be used as part of, or in conjunction with, traditional travel forecasting models. The research developed leads to much more robust transit modeling capabilities for regions, cities and transit agencies, allowing governments to invest scarce resources in order to achieve the economic, social and environmental goals associated with greater transit ridership.

Of particular interest are questions: Does the provision of transit passes provide increased access to recreation, employment and other opportunities? Do students with transit passes experience greater travel independence and, as a result, rely less on chauffeuring by parents and others? If the above holds true, do households experience travel cost savings in terms of both time and money? Application of smart-phones to gather travel behavior in the City of Edmonton Funded by: The City of Edmonton in partnership with R.A. Malatest This research project presents the opportunity to commercialize Ph.D. research conducted at the University of Waterloo. Data \u2013 origin, destination, mode, and path \u2013 were gathered for a large sample of households and travelers in Edmonton to inform the development of a travel forecasting model. The passively collected smart-phone data were used to calibrate and validate information gathered through traditional travel diaries. iCity Urban Informatics for Sustainable Metropolitan Growth Funded by: Ontario Research Foundation (ORF). Grant led by the University of Toronto (Eric Miller) Research aimed at understanding how innovations in travel data collection (both methods and specific information) can better inform decision-making to advance sustainable transportation and cities.Specific questions to be addressed in Waterloo include: How will the investment in Light Rail Transit (LRT) change overall Regional travel patterns? How important will the Region\u2019s Central Transit Corridor (CTC) become for attracting trips? How will travel within the CTC, especially tours, evolve over time as the density and diversity of land uses change? Light Rail and Core Area Intensification \u2013 Unpacking Causal Relationships Funded by: SSHRC (Partnership Development Grant) PI is Dawn Parker, School of Planning Much research has been conducted on the relationship between land use and transportation, particularly the influence of land use investments on density.This research explores these relationships in the Region of Waterloo as a result of the LRT project.This research takes a combined approach to try and demonstrate causality of land use impacts by: Using hedonic pricing techniques to isolate the impacts of proximity to the LRT on land / home values; Interview developers to understand (quantitatively and qualitatively) their perceptions of LRT on market dynamics; Interview home buyers, home sellers, and renters to determine the perceived value of access resulting from LRT. Sustainable Transportation Modeling Funded by: NSERC (Discovery Grant) Research supported significant development of novel data collection and analysis techniques, particularly related to sustain transportation modes \u2013 walking, cycling and transit. Improving transit representation in travel forecasting models Funded by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) The research program develops mathematical methods to represent the dynamic relationship among transit frequency, ridership, and fiscal constraints. The models generated can be used as part of, or in conjunction with, traditional travel forecasting models. The research developed leads to much more robust transit modeling capabilities for regions, cities and transit agencies, allowing governments to invest scarce resources in order to achieve the economic, social and environmental goals associated with greater transit ridership.

How will travel within the CTC, especially tours, evolve over time as the density and diversity of land uses change? Light Rail and Core Area Intensification \u2013 Unpacking Causal Relationships Funded by: SSHRC (Partnership Development Grant) PI is Dawn Parker, School of Planning Much research has been conducted on the relationship between land use and transportation, particularly the influence of land use investments on density.This research explores these relationships in the Region of Waterloo as a result of the LRT project.This research takes a combined approach to try and demonstrate causality of land use impacts by: Using hedonic pricing techniques to isolate the impacts of proximity to the LRT on land / home values; Interview developers to understand (quantitatively and qualitatively) their perceptions of LRT on market dynamics; Interview home buyers, home sellers, and renters to determine the perceived value of access resulting from LRT. Sustainable Transportation Modeling Funded by: NSERC (Discovery Grant) Research supported significant development of novel data collection and analysis techniques, particularly related to sustain transportation modes \u2013 walking, cycling and transit. Improving transit representation in travel forecasting models Funded by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) The research program develops mathematical methods to represent the dynamic relationship among transit frequency, ridership, and fiscal constraints. The models generated can be used as part of, or in conjunction with, traditional travel forecasting models. The research developed leads to much more robust transit modeling capabilities for regions, cities and transit agencies, allowing governments to invest scarce resources in order to achieve the economic, social and environmental goals associated with greater transit ridership.

Empirical studies abound on the ecological consequences of covering and uncovering urban streams such as, the hydrological effects (e.g. runoff and flooding) and geomorphological impacts (e.g. rise in temperatures and decreased fish habitat). Yet, there is a dearth in studies that address the links between urban stream daylighting and climate change adaptation and mitigation, and also, the enhancement of the public realm. Therefore, Dr. Khirfan\u2019s research project draws on landscape ecology, urban morphology, and urban design theories to investigate the potential of urban stream daylighting at three interrelated levels: The macro eco-system level where daylighting urban streams may contribute to offsetting water scarcity in arid climates as a climate change adaptation response; The meso urban morphological level where daylighting urban streams intersects with the complex issues of urban development including, the political economy of place production as well as the improvement of mobility (public transit, cycling, and walkability to reduce green house gas (GHG) emissions as a climate change mitigation measure at; and The micro place-making level where urban stream daylighting intersects with place representation as well as with the creation of the public realm and how the involvement of the local communities in the decision-making processes may be deployed to ameliorate the quality of life. The Research Questions Specifically, this research project investigates the following research questions: What are the current scope and nature of the urban stream daylighting practice? What lessons can be learned from this current practice to inform future ecological planning and design? How might the daylighting of urban streams and their ecological regeneration become catalysts for climate adaptation and mitigation? How do the covering and the daylighting of urban streams influence the meso-level urban morphology (e.g. transit and land use) and the micro-level public space design? And, how can vernacular architecture and contemporary local knowledge inform the practice of daylighting? The Research Approach and Case Studies Through a rigorous review of the literature, this research project will build an on-line database that documents urban stream daylighting projects from across the globe so as to develop a better understanding of the scope and nature of daylighting and identify the criteria for best practices. Concurrently, a cross-national comparative case study research design will guide an in-depth study of two recent urban stream projects: the Seil in Amman, Jordan and the Cheonggyecheon in Seoul, South Korea. The remarkable similarities between the two streams include: their covering in the 1950s to prioritize urban infrastructure \u2013 a major street in Amman and an expressway in Seoul; their links to regional watersheds (the Zarqa River in Jordan and the Han River in Korea); their length and location extending for nearly eight kilometres at the core of the country\u2019s capital; their strong historic associations with the surrounding urban fabric. Yet while Amman\u2019s project completely covered the Seil and replaced it with a manufactured stream, Seoul\u2019s project sought to ecologically regenerate the Cheoggyechoen and improve public transit. Through a qualitative and participatory methodology, this research project will involve GIS layering of historic and contemporary maps; visual typological analyses; content analysis of planning documents; and design charrettes with local planning experts and laypeople. The design charrettes will be deployed as tools for: participatory design, data collection, and knowledge exchange.

Empirical studies abound on the ecological consequences of covering and uncovering urban streams such as, the hydrological effects (e.g. runoff and flooding) and geomorphological impacts (e.g. rise in temperatures and decreased fish habitat). Yet, there is a dearth in studies that address the links between urban stream daylighting and climate change adaptation and mitigation, and also, the enhancement of the public realm. Therefore, Dr. Khirfan\u2019s research project draws on landscape ecology, urban morphology, and urban design theories to investigate the potential of urban stream daylighting at three interrelated levels: The macro eco-system level where daylighting urban streams may contribute to offsetting water scarcity in arid climates as a climate change adaptation response; The meso urban morphological level where daylighting urban streams intersects with the complex issues of urban development including, the political economy of place production as well as the improvement of mobility (public transit, cycling, and walkability to reduce green house gas (GHG) emissions as a climate change mitigation measure at; and The micro place-making level where urban stream daylighting intersects with place representation as well as with the creation of the public realm and how the involvement of the local communities in the decision-making processes may be deployed to ameliorate the quality of life. The Research Questions Specifically, this research project investigates the following research questions: What are the current scope and nature of the urban stream daylighting practice? What lessons can be learned from this current practice to inform future ecological planning and design? How might the daylighting of urban streams and their ecological regeneration become catalysts for climate adaptation and mitigation? How do the covering and the daylighting of urban streams influence the meso-level urban morphology (e.g. transit and land use) and the micro-level public space design? And, how can vernacular architecture and contemporary local knowledge inform the practice of daylighting? The Research Approach and Case Studies Through a rigorous review of the literature, this research project will build an on-line database that documents urban stream daylighting projects from across the globe so as to develop a better understanding of the scope and nature of daylighting and identify the criteria for best practices. Concurrently, a cross-national comparative case study research design will guide an in-depth study of two recent urban stream projects: the Seil in Amman, Jordan and the Cheonggyecheon in Seoul, South Korea. The remarkable similarities between the two streams include: their covering in the 1950s to prioritize urban infrastructure \u2013 a major street in Amman and an expressway in Seoul; their links to regional watersheds (the Zarqa River in Jordan and the Han River in Korea); their length and location extending for nearly eight kilometres at the core of the country\u2019s capital; their strong historic associations with the surrounding urban fabric. Yet while Amman\u2019s project completely covered the Seil and replaced it with a manufactured stream, Seoul\u2019s project sought to ecologically regenerate the Cheoggyechoen and improve public transit. Through a qualitative and participatory methodology, this research project will involve GIS layering of historic and contemporary maps; visual typological analyses; content analysis of planning documents; and design charrettes with local planning experts and laypeople. The design charrettes will be deployed as tools for: participatory design, data collection, and knowledge exchange.

Empirical studies abound on the ecological consequences of covering and uncovering urban streams such as, the hydrological effects (e.g. runoff and flooding) and geomorphological impacts (e.g. rise in temperatures and decreased fish habitat). Yet, there is a dearth in studies that address the links between urban stream daylighting and climate change adaptation and mitigation, and also, the enhancement of the public realm. Therefore, Dr. Khirfan\u2019s research project draws on landscape ecology, urban morphology, and urban design theories to investigate the potential of urban stream daylighting at three interrelated levels: The macro eco-system level where daylighting urban streams may contribute to offsetting water scarcity in arid climates as a climate change adaptation response; The meso urban morphological level where daylighting urban streams intersects with the complex issues of urban development including, the political economy of place production as well as the improvement of mobility (public transit, cycling, and walkability to reduce green house gas (GHG) emissions as a climate change mitigation measure at; and The micro place-making level where urban stream daylighting intersects with place representation as well as with the creation of the public realm and how the involvement of the local communities in the decision-making processes may be deployed to ameliorate the quality of life. The Research Questions Specifically, this research project investigates the following research questions: What are the current scope and nature of the urban stream daylighting practice? What lessons can be learned from this current practice to inform future ecological planning and design? How might the daylighting of urban streams and their ecological regeneration become catalysts for climate adaptation and mitigation? How do the covering and the daylighting of urban streams influence the meso-level urban morphology (e.g. transit and land use) and the micro-level public space design? And, how can vernacular architecture and contemporary local knowledge inform the practice of daylighting? The Research Approach and Case Studies Through a rigorous review of the literature, this research project will build an on-line database that documents urban stream daylighting projects from across the globe so as to develop a better understanding of the scope and nature of daylighting and identify the criteria for best practices. Concurrently, a cross-national comparative case study research design will guide an in-depth study of two recent urban stream projects: the Seil in Amman, Jordan and the Cheonggyecheon in Seoul, South Korea. The remarkable similarities between the two streams include: their covering in the 1950s to prioritize urban infrastructure \u2013 a major street in Amman and an expressway in Seoul; their links to regional watersheds (the Zarqa River in Jordan and the Han River in Korea); their length and location extending for nearly eight kilometres at the core of the country\u2019s capital; their strong historic associations with the surrounding urban fabric. Yet while Amman\u2019s project completely covered the Seil and replaced it with a manufactured stream, Seoul\u2019s project sought to ecologically regenerate the Cheoggyechoen and improve public transit. Through a qualitative and participatory methodology, this research project will involve GIS layering of historic and contemporary maps; visual typological analyses; content analysis of planning documents; and design charrettes with local planning experts and laypeople. The design charrettes will be deployed as tools for: participatory design, data collection, and knowledge exchange.

Empirical studies abound on the ecological consequences of covering and uncovering urban streams such as, the hydrological effects (e.g. runoff and flooding) and geomorphological impacts (e.g. rise in temperatures and decreased fish habitat). Yet, there is a dearth in studies that address the links between urban stream daylighting and climate change adaptation and mitigation, and also, the enhancement of the public realm. Therefore, Dr. Khirfan\u2019s research project draws on landscape ecology, urban morphology, and urban design theories to investigate the potential of urban stream daylighting at three interrelated levels: The macro eco-system level where daylighting urban streams may contribute to offsetting water scarcity in arid climates as a climate change adaptation response; The meso urban morphological level where daylighting urban streams intersects with the complex issues of urban development including, the political economy of place production as well as the improvement of mobility (public transit, cycling, and walkability to reduce green house gas (GHG) emissions as a climate change mitigation measure at; and The micro place-making level where urban stream daylighting intersects with place representation as well as with the creation of the public realm and how the involvement of the local communities in the decision-making processes may be deployed to ameliorate the quality of life. The Research Questions Specifically, this research project investigates the following research questions: What are the current scope and nature of the urban stream daylighting practice? What lessons can be learned from this current practice to inform future ecological planning and design? How might the daylighting of urban streams and their ecological regeneration become catalysts for climate adaptation and mitigation? How do the covering and the daylighting of urban streams influence the meso-level urban morphology (e.g. transit and land use) and the micro-level public space design? And, how can vernacular architecture and contemporary local knowledge inform the practice of daylighting? The Research Approach and Case Studies Through a rigorous review of the literature, this research project will build an on-line database that documents urban stream daylighting projects from across the globe so as to develop a better understanding of the scope and nature of daylighting and identify the criteria for best practices. Concurrently, a cross-national comparative case study research design will guide an in-depth study of two recent urban stream projects: the Seil in Amman, Jordan and the Cheonggyecheon in Seoul, South Korea. The remarkable similarities between the two streams include: their covering in the 1950s to prioritize urban infrastructure \u2013 a major street in Amman and an expressway in Seoul; their links to regional watersheds (the Zarqa River in Jordan and the Han River in Korea); their length and location extending for nearly eight kilometres at the core of the country\u2019s capital; their strong historic associations with the surrounding urban fabric. Yet while Amman\u2019s project completely covered the Seil and replaced it with a manufactured stream, Seoul\u2019s project sought to ecologically regenerate the Cheoggyechoen and improve public transit. Through a qualitative and participatory methodology, this research project will involve GIS layering of historic and contemporary maps; visual typological analyses; content analysis of planning documents; and design charrettes with local planning experts and laypeople. The design charrettes will be deployed as tools for: participatory design, data collection, and knowledge exchange.

Empirical studies abound on the ecological consequences of covering and uncovering urban streams such as, the hydrological effects (e.g. runoff and flooding) and geomorphological impacts (e.g. rise in temperatures and decreased fish habitat). Yet, there is a dearth in studies that address the links between urban stream daylighting and climate change adaptation and mitigation, and also, the enhancement of the public realm. Therefore, Dr. Khirfan\u2019s research project draws on landscape ecology, urban morphology, and urban design theories to investigate the potential of urban stream daylighting at three interrelated levels: The macro eco-system level where daylighting urban streams may contribute to offsetting water scarcity in arid climates as a climate change adaptation response; The meso urban morphological level where daylighting urban streams intersects with the complex issues of urban development including, the political economy of place production as well as the improvement of mobility (public transit, cycling, and walkability to reduce green house gas (GHG) emissions as a climate change mitigation measure at; and The micro place-making level where urban stream daylighting intersects with place representation as well as with the creation of the public realm and how the involvement of the local communities in the decision-making processes may be deployed to ameliorate the quality of life. The Research Questions Specifically, this research project investigates the following research questions: What are the current scope and nature of the urban stream daylighting practice? What lessons can be learned from this current practice to inform future ecological planning and design? How might the daylighting of urban streams and their ecological regeneration become catalysts for climate adaptation and mitigation? How do the covering and the daylighting of urban streams influence the meso-level urban morphology (e.g. transit and land use) and the micro-level public space design? And, how can vernacular architecture and contemporary local knowledge inform the practice of daylighting? The Research Approach and Case Studies Through a rigorous review of the literature, this research project will build an on-line database that documents urban stream daylighting projects from across the globe so as to develop a better understanding of the scope and nature of daylighting and identify the criteria for best practices. Concurrently, a cross-national comparative case study research design will guide an in-depth study of two recent urban stream projects: the Seil in Amman, Jordan and the Cheonggyecheon in Seoul, South Korea. The remarkable similarities between the two streams include: their covering in the 1950s to prioritize urban infrastructure \u2013 a major street in Amman and an expressway in Seoul; their links to regional watersheds (the Zarqa River in Jordan and the Han River in Korea); their length and location extending for nearly eight kilometres at the core of the country\u2019s capital; their strong historic associations with the surrounding urban fabric. Yet while Amman\u2019s project completely covered the Seil and replaced it with a manufactured stream, Seoul\u2019s project sought to ecologically regenerate the Cheoggyechoen and improve public transit. Through a qualitative and participatory methodology, this research project will involve GIS layering of historic and contemporary maps; visual typological analyses; content analysis of planning documents; and design charrettes with local planning experts and laypeople. The design charrettes will be deployed as tools for: participatory design, data collection, and knowledge exchange.

Yet, there is a dearth in studies that address the links between urban stream daylighting and climate change adaptation and mitigation, and also, the enhancement of the public realm. Therefore, Dr. Khirfan\u2019s research project draws on landscape ecology, urban morphology, and urban design theories to investigate the potential of urban stream daylighting at three interrelated levels: \n The macro eco-system level where daylighting urban streams may contribute to offsetting water scarcity in arid climates as a climate change adaptation response; The meso urban morphological level where daylighting urban streams intersects with the complex issues of urban development including, the political economy of place production as well as the improvement of mobility (public transit, cycling, and walkability to reduce green house gas (GHG) emissions as a climate change mitigation measure at; and The micro place-making level where urban stream daylighting intersects with place representation as well as with the creation of the public realm and how the involvement of the local communities in the decision-making processes may be deployed to ameliorate the quality of life. \n The macro eco-system level where daylighting urban streams may contribute to offsetting water scarcity in arid climates as a climate change adaptation response; \n The meso urban morphological level where daylighting urban streams intersects with the complex issues of urban development including, the political economy of place production as well as the improvement of mobility (public transit, cycling, and walkability to reduce green house gas (GHG) emissions as a climate change mitigation measure at; and \n The micro place-making level where urban stream daylighting intersects with place representation as well as with the creation of the public realm and how the involvement of the local communities in the decision-making processes may be deployed to ameliorate the quality of life. \n The Research Questions\n Specifically, this research project investigates the following research questions: What are the current scope and nature of the urban stream daylighting practice? What lessons can be learned from this current practice to inform future ecological planning and design? How might the daylighting of urban streams and their ecological regeneration become catalysts for climate adaptation and mitigation? How do the covering and the daylighting of urban streams influence the meso-level urban morphology (e.g. transit and land use) and the micro-level public space design? And, how can vernacular architecture and contemporary local knowledge inform the practice of daylighting? \n Specifically, this research project investigates the following research questions: What are the current scope and nature of the urban stream daylighting practice?

How do the covering and the daylighting of urban streams influence the meso-level urban morphology (e.g. transit and land use) and the micro-level public space design? And, how can vernacular architecture and contemporary local knowledge inform the practice of daylighting?\n The Research Approach and Case Studies\n Through a rigorous review of the literature, this research project will build an on-line database that documents urban stream daylighting projects from across the globe so as to develop a better understanding of the scope and nature of daylighting and identify the criteria for best practices. Concurrently, a cross-national comparative case study research design will guide an in-depth study of two recent urban stream projects: the Seil in Amman, Jordan and the Cheonggyecheon in Seoul, South Korea. The remarkable similarities between the two streams include: their covering in the 1950s to prioritize urban infrastructure \u2013 a major street in Amman and an expressway in Seoul; their links to regional watersheds (the Zarqa River in Jordan and the Han River in Korea); their length and location extending for nearly eight kilometres at the core of the country\u2019s capital; their strong historic associations with the surrounding urban fabric. Yet while Amman\u2019s project completely covered the Seil and replaced it with a manufactured stream, Seoul\u2019s project sought to ecologically regenerate the Cheoggyechoen and improve public transit. Through a qualitative and participatory methodology, this research project will involve GIS layering of historic and contemporary maps; visual typological analyses; content analysis of planning documents; and design charrettes with local planning experts and laypeople. The design charrettes will be deployed as tools for: participatory design, data collection, and knowledge exchange. \n Completed Research Projects (Selected)\n Title: A Contested Public Realm: Development, Inequality, and Mobility in Amman and Beirut Funding source: Arab Council for the Social Sciences, Beirut Role: PI (Co-applicant: Eliana Abu-Hamdi, Berkeley) Amount: US $45,000 Grant period: 2013-2015 \n Title:\n\n Funding source:\n\n Role:\n\n Amount:\n\n Grant period:\n Title: The Middle East\u2019s New Urban Landscape: Inclusive Urban Planning or Democratic Deficit?

The project links agent-based modeling of human behaviours driving land use / land cover change (LULCC), preferences for vegetation cover and vegetation management, land market modeling, field work, remote sensing, and ecosystem modeling of landscape carbon balance in low-density human-dominated landscapes (suburban and exurban residential landscapes). My team will develop agent-based land market models, whose effects will be compared to the non-market land allocation mechanism used in the original SLUCE model.

My team will develop agent-based land market models, whose effects will be compared to the non-market land allocation mechanism used in the original SLUCE model. \n And for something a little different that combines art and science, see the 2015 Bridges lecture \"Dancing the math of complex systems\": \n Remote video URL View on YouTube \n Remote video URL View on YouTube \n Remote video URL \n Remote video URL \n Remote video URL \nRemote video URL\n \n\n View on YouTube \nView on YouTube\n Contact Dawn Parker for more information on research opportunities.

To visit Chantel\u2019s research website, see the Wildlife Ecohydrology and Conservation Lab. Key areas of Graduate Supervision: wildlife ecology, spatial and landscape ecology, conservation biology, ecohydrology, habitat restoration, herpetology Recent Courses Taught ENVS 278: Applied Statistics for Environmental Research Research Interests The goal of Chantel\u2019s interdisciplinary research program is to advance our knowledge and understanding of the spatiotemporal effects of climate change disturbances (e.g., wildfire, drought, weather whiplash) on the resilience and vulnerability of threatened wildlife and their habitats. This collaborative research supports evidence-based policies for the conservation and management of healthy reptile populations and habitat. Three main research themes include: Effects of climate-mediated disturbances on habitat use and function. Climate change disturbances such as wildfire, drought, and weather whiplash events are increasing in frequency and severity. The effects of these climate-mediated disturbances on habitat function have consequences for the long-term persistence of vulnerable ecosystems (e.g., wetlands) and threatened wildlife (e.g., reptiles) that rely on these habitats. It is critical to understand how multiple stressors effect habitat function to support data-driven wildlife management and habitat restoration strategies in a changing climate. Learn more about this research here. Climate refugia: Detecting and predicting change. Identifying ecosystems resilient to climate change is recognized as essential for conservation strategies. However, wetland ecosystems may respond differently to stressors depending on the strength of ecohydrological feedbacks, resulting in fluctuations in habitat availability and suitability. Therefore, our ability to detect and predict spatiotemporal changes in climate refugia will be instrumental in guiding management decisions and informing policy. Learn more about this research here. Habitat restoration: enhancing resilience to climate change. In an era of unprecedented change, habitat restoration techniques can be used to enhance habitat resilience to climate change. Weather conditions and lack of organic soil are current limitations to habitat restoration and creation in rock barrens landscapes. Through collaborative research, I aim to create innovative, interdisciplinary restoration approaches to restore habitat conditions to ensure reptile population persistence.

Key areas of Graduate Supervision: wildlife ecology, spatial and landscape ecology, conservation biology, ecohydrology, habitat restoration, herpetology Recent Courses Taught ENVS 278: Applied Statistics for Environmental Research Research Interests The goal of Chantel\u2019s interdisciplinary research program is to advance our knowledge and understanding of the spatiotemporal effects of climate change disturbances (e.g., wildfire, drought, weather whiplash) on the resilience and vulnerability of threatened wildlife and their habitats. This collaborative research supports evidence-based policies for the conservation and management of healthy reptile populations and habitat. Three main research themes include: Effects of climate-mediated disturbances on habitat use and function. Climate change disturbances such as wildfire, drought, and weather whiplash events are increasing in frequency and severity. The effects of these climate-mediated disturbances on habitat function have consequences for the long-term persistence of vulnerable ecosystems (e.g., wetlands) and threatened wildlife (e.g., reptiles) that rely on these habitats. It is critical to understand how multiple stressors effect habitat function to support data-driven wildlife management and habitat restoration strategies in a changing climate. Learn more about this research here. Climate refugia: Detecting and predicting change. Identifying ecosystems resilient to climate change is recognized as essential for conservation strategies. However, wetland ecosystems may respond differently to stressors depending on the strength of ecohydrological feedbacks, resulting in fluctuations in habitat availability and suitability. Therefore, our ability to detect and predict spatiotemporal changes in climate refugia will be instrumental in guiding management decisions and informing policy. Learn more about this research here. Habitat restoration: enhancing resilience to climate change. In an era of unprecedented change, habitat restoration techniques can be used to enhance habitat resilience to climate change. Weather conditions and lack of organic soil are current limitations to habitat restoration and creation in rock barrens landscapes. Through collaborative research, I aim to create innovative, interdisciplinary restoration approaches to restore habitat conditions to ensure reptile population persistence.

This collaborative research supports evidence-based policies for the conservation and management of healthy reptile populations and habitat. Three main research themes include:\n \nEffects of climate-mediated disturbances on habitat use and function. Climate change disturbances such as wildfire, drought, and weather whiplash events are increasing in frequency and severity. The effects of these climate-mediated disturbances on habitat function have consequences for the long-term persistence of vulnerable ecosystems (e.g., wetlands) and threatened wildlife (e.g., reptiles) that rely on these habitats. It is critical to understand how multiple stressors effect habitat function to support data-driven wildlife management and habitat restoration strategies in a changing climate. Learn more about this research here.\nEffects of climate-mediated disturbances on habitat use and function.\n here\n \nClimate refugia: Detecting and predicting change. Identifying ecosystems resilient to climate change is recognized as essential for conservation strategies. However, wetland ecosystems may respond differently to stressors depending on the strength of ecohydrological feedbacks, resulting in fluctuations in habitat availability and suitability. Therefore, our ability to detect and predict spatiotemporal changes in climate refugia will be instrumental in guiding management decisions and informing policy. Learn more about this research here.\nClimate refugia: Detecting and predicting change.\n here\n \nHabitat restoration: enhancing resilience to climate change. In an era of unprecedented change, habitat restoration techniques can be used to enhance habitat resilience to climate change. Weather conditions and lack of organic soil are current limitations to habitat restoration and creation in rock barrens landscapes. Through collaborative research, I aim to create innovative, interdisciplinary restoration approaches to restore habitat conditions to ensure reptile population persistence.

Much of this is done collaboratively, e.g. https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/ecorestoration/\n https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/ecorestoration/\nFor conservation, the focus has been geared towards long term planning and management, especially at the international level as well as regional projects on invasive species, rare species, and endangered species.\nIn addition to the eponymous areas of conservation and restoration ecology, CaRE\u2019s research is tied to tests of socioecological resilience in a variety of locales around the world and in many anthropogenic and more \u2018wild\u2019 lands and waters (industrial sites, urban areas, agroecosystems, parks and protected areas).\nThe research includes many different types of taxa as indicators (plants, fungi, amphibians, arthropods) and different ecosystems (old fields, prairies, forests, dunes, wetlands, riparian zones, mountains, valleys, deserts, and even the Arctic on occasion). Steve's lab is question or problem focused rather than concerned with the taxon or type of ecosystem to be studied.\nSteve is Editor-in-Chief of Restoration Ecology, the flagship (official) journal of the international Society for Ecological Restoration.\nRestoration Ecology\nSteve is involved with the Centre for Applied Sciences in Ontario Protected Areas (CASIOPA) and the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) plus numerous other national and international agencies and projects. He has presented over 200 talks at international conferences and authored several hundred academic, professional, practitioner, and policy papers.\nCASIOPA\nELA\nSteve\u2019s research projects mainly are focused on restoring or conserving ecological communities or national and international ecological management. Students are encouraged to develop their own focus and independent projects though they should relate to Steve\u2019s overarching research areas listed above.

Using the analogy that islands function like living organisms, he conducts socio-metabolic research to evaluate how small island economies utilize (or metabolize) materials, energy, water, and infrastructure. He investigates why and how these consumption patterns (or island metabolism) may accumulate \u201csocio-metabolic risk\u201d over time that increase their susceptibility to the challenges of climate change. He further analyzes how island economies can transition to a more sustainable, circular resource-use model, thereby bolstering their overall resilience to the impact of climate change.

This project involves an in depth review of the roles that corporate actors play in governance, especially agribusiness conglomerates. \n 519-888-4567, ext. 48317a2collin@uwaterloo.ca Andrea Collins\u2019 research projects ask questions about the role of gender in the governance of food, land, and agriculture, both locally and globally. Andrea\u2019s research builds upon conceptions of local, national, and global governance by considering the gendered sociopolitical dynamics that discipline land use and governance in East Africa. This research identifies gaps in global land governance initiatives that fail to consider the role of gender norms in the control and governance of land in local contexts.

It addresses the overarching question: under what conditions do sport events have positive impacts for individuals and organizations in host communities? My research draws from diverse disciplinary perspectives (e.g., social psychology, geography) and methodological approaches. The knowledge generated from my work is aimed to improve event management practices in ways that maximize participation and economic-related impacts that can result from hosting elite-sport events. To this end, my research falls within two broad themes: (i) Exploring the role of elite-sport events in the promotion of physical activity and sport participation; and (ii) exploring commercial and tourism-related responses to elite sport events.

He joined the Department of Kinesiology and Health Sciences at Waterloo in 2000. Recognized for his strong leadership, Rush previously held numerous administrative positions within the Faculty of Health including dean, associate dean graduate studies and research, and chair of the Department of Kinesiology and Health Sciences. \u200bResearch interests My cardiovascular research interests relate to regulation of blood vessel function and the signaling pathways in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells that control this function. In particular, I am interested in the effects of hypertension, age, and exercise on blood vessel health. Our recent work has focused on discovering regulatory influences on endothelium derived contracting factors, and on the effects of the red wine polyphenol resveratrol on vascular function.

I mobilize with Becoming Coalition, a group of subversive scholars whom out of organic, radical collaborations move with shared radical politic athwart identities against tyranny and toward useful connections grounded in love, respect, and community among the academy\u2019s oppressive structures and beyond. Together we grapple with current moments of racialized formations (Omi & Winant, 1994), pandemic practices, academic policing, equity projects (EDI) and our use amongst it all. We constantly find ourselves \u201cformulating critique of the ways that social justice movements have felt, and where [our] longing for something else was strongest\u201d (Brown, 2017, p. 44). Our current work engages \u201clonging as method\u201d for unearthing those embodied yearnings that arise within us against discontents, empty promises, and institutional lackings towards useful questionings, hope-full cravings, and progressive desires for more just futurities for our world(s), academies, and utopias beyond. In conversation with various radical thinkactors, we, as Becoming Coalition, trace our longings as method for mobilizing and organizing towards more beautiful worldsenses (Oy\u00e9w\u00f9mi,, 1997).

We begin with, and constantly revisit, a question that moves us to action, triggered by our readings of Ahmed (2019): how can we continuously become of use to ourselves, each other, and our communities? \nresearch\nBecoming Coalition\nagainst\ntoward\nour use\nlonging as method\nagainst\ntowards\ntrace our longings\nas method\nhow can we continuously become of use to ourselves, each other, and our communities? \nGraduate supervision and student opportunities\nI am currently accepting applications from graduate students with research interests related to:\n Liberatory social theorypractices (critical, feminist, critical race, Black radicalisms, poststructural, queer, decolonizing, post humanist, abolition) Qualitative methodologies and decolonizing critiques of inquiry as invasion Sociopolitical mobilizing/organizing/transformation with/in community Creative Analytic Practices/Reverse research \n Liberatory social theorypractices (critical, feminist, critical race, Black radicalisms, poststructural, queer, decolonizing, post humanist, abolition) \nLiberatory social theorypractices (critical, feminist, critical race, Black radicalisms, poststructural, queer, decolonizing, post humanist, abolition)\n Qualitative methodologies and decolonizing critiques of inquiry as invasion \nQualitative methodologies and decolonizing critiques of inquiry as invasion \nmethodologies\n Sociopolitical mobilizing/organizing/transformation with/in community \nSociopolitical mobilizing/organizing/transformation with/in community \n Creative Analytic Practices/Reverse research \nCreative Analytic Practices/Reverse research\nresearch\nCurrent Student Project Topics: abolishing the medical-industrial complex; complicating food care practices on stolen land; queer anti-gentrification; resisting gentrification in Little Jamacia, Toronto; understanding Black men\u2019s racial formations towards health in higher education; and non-extractive tourisms for anti-capitalist, anti-colonialist escape. \nabolishing the medical-industrial complex; complicating food care practices on stolen land; queer anti-gentrification; resisting gentrification in Little Jamacia, Toronto; understanding Black men\u2019s racial formations towards health in higher education; \n non-extractive tourisms for anti-capitalist, anti-colonialist escape. \nGraduate studies application details\nGraduate studies application details\nTeaching interests\n Social theorypractices Qualitative Inquiry/Post Inquiry Community transformation/Structural change Liberatory Leisure Onto-epistemological frameworks \n Social theorypractices \nSocial theorypractices \n Qualitative Inquiry/Post Inquiry \nQualitative Inquiry/Post Inquiry\n Community transformation/Structural change \nCommunity transformation/Structural change\n Liberatory Leisure \nLiberatory Leisure\n Onto-epistemological frameworks \nOnto-epistemological frameworks\nOnto-epistemological frameworks\nCourses\nREC 201: Leisure and Social Justice REC 663: Foundations for Qualitative Inquiry REC 700: Foundations of Knowledge in Leisure Studies \nREC 201: Leisure and Social Justice\nREC 663: Foundations for Qualitative Inquiry\nREC 700: Foundations of Knowledge in Leisure Studies\nEducation\nBA, Ithaca College\nMSc, SUNY Cortland\nPhD with graduate certificates in women's studies and interdisciplinary qualitative research, University of Georgia\nSelected publications\nSee Google Scholar for a full list of publications.\nGoogle Scholar\nBerbary, L.A. & Mohamed, L.A.

She teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on the theory and application of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies. Her interdisciplinary research interests are in the fields of geomatics and spatial data analysis with diverse application areas in urban geography, public health, crime, environmental monitoring, and climate change. She has an international and intercultural background, born in Edmonton, Alberta and raised in Rabaul, Papua New Guinea. Research interests: Geographic information systems (GIS) and geomatics Remote sensing and satellite applications Spatial data analysis and spatial statistics Urban geography, environmental criminology, and crime mapping Public health and spatial epidemiology Environmental monitoring and climate change Land cover, vegetation, and climatology GIScience education My research interests are in the field of spatial data analysis and geomatics with diverse application areas that span physical and human geography disciplines. I teach undergraduate and graduate courses on the theory and application of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies. Current research projects include exploring threshold concepts and teaching in the GISciences, crime mapping in Toronto and the Kitchener-Waterloo region, and remote sensing for examining biogeophysical patterns, such as how land cover and ecosystem properties are affected by surface climate and weather systems. Previous projects have included studying nitrogen uptake in montane forests of the Andes (Peru) and a NASA-funded project exploring the application of GIS and data mining techniques for understanding high dimensional remotely sensed images and climate data. My PhD research at the University of Cambridge (UK) focused on developing similar spatial data analysis methodologies from an urban geography perspective, exploring the links between public health and crime, a project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Currently, I hold the position of Chair of the Space Applications Department in the Space Studies Program (SSP) and serve on the Academic Council as a Faculty member at the International Space University (ISU). I have a keen interest in continuing research in the related areas of conservation science and environmental health while focusing on the application of statistical tools and geographic information technologies.

I teach undergraduate and graduate courses on the theory and application of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies. Current research projects include exploring threshold concepts and teaching in the GISciences, crime mapping in Toronto and the Kitchener-Waterloo region, and remote sensing for examining biogeophysical patterns, such as how land cover and ecosystem properties are affected by surface climate and weather systems. Previous projects have included studying nitrogen uptake in montane forests of the Andes (Peru) and a NASA-funded project exploring the application of GIS and data mining techniques for understanding high dimensional remotely sensed images and climate data. My PhD research at the University of Cambridge (UK) focused on developing similar spatial data analysis methodologies from an urban geography perspective, exploring the links between public health and crime, a project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Research interests: Geographic information systems (GIS) and geomatics Remote sensing and satellite applications Spatial data analysis and spatial statistics Urban geography, environmental criminology, and crime mapping Public health and spatial epidemiology Environmental monitoring and climate change Land cover, vegetation, and climatology GIScience education My research interests are in the field of spatial data analysis and geomatics with diverse application areas that span physical and human geography disciplines. I teach undergraduate and graduate courses on the theory and application of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies. Current research projects include exploring threshold concepts and teaching in the GISciences, crime mapping in Toronto and the Kitchener-Waterloo region, and remote sensing for examining biogeophysical patterns, such as how land cover and ecosystem properties are affected by surface climate and weather systems. Previous projects have included studying nitrogen uptake in montane forests of the Andes (Peru) and a NASA-funded project exploring the application of GIS and data mining techniques for understanding high dimensional remotely sensed images and climate data. My PhD research at the University of Cambridge (UK) focused on developing similar spatial data analysis methodologies from an urban geography perspective, exploring the links between public health and crime, a project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Currently, I hold the position of Chair of the Space Applications Department in the Space Studies Program (SSP) and serve on the Academic Council as a Faculty member at the International Space University (ISU).

I\u2019m really intrigued by the flows of people and goods that underpin social and economic interactions and the complex impacts of those flows. Recent projects include: \n 1. Analyzing Ontario\u2019s transportation sector and climate change impacts and adaptation 2. Exploring Freight Land Use \u2013 from \u201cfreight sprawl\u201d to delivery hubs and fulfillment spaces of last mile logistics. 3. Gig economy and freight \u2013 the work of last mile delivery and the urban implications \u2013 City Logistics 4. Autonomous mobility \n\n\n\n I have an ongoing interest in a range of transportation policy issues and have previously published on subjects including emissions forecasting, impacts of climate change adaptations on freight, regulatory policy, urban freight planning, freight and land use, autonomous vehicles and retail transitions and freight. \n My graduate students have a diverse range of research topics that involve various elements of transportation, spatial analysis, regional and urban economics, and sustainability.Recent examples include \n Autonomous vehicle adoption potential in Canadian cities Factors influencing regional rail ridership A model to understand the ION LRT impact on commuting mode choice Co-modality \u2013 moving people and goods together GHG Emissions Inventory and the potential of electrification \n Autonomous vehicle adoption potential in Canadian cities Factors influencing regional rail ridership \n Autonomous vehicle adoption potential in Canadian cities Factors influencing regional rail ridership \n A model to understand the ION LRT impact on commuting mode choice \n A model to understand the ION LRT impact on commuting mode choice \n Co-modality \u2013 moving people and goods together \n Co-modality \u2013 moving people and goods together \n GHG Emissions Inventory and the potential of electrification \n GHG Emissions Inventory and the potential of electrification \n Contact Clarence Woudsma for more information on research opportunities. \n Clarence Woudsma\n Graduate student supervision\n Number of students currently supervising/co-supervising Total number of student supervisions/co-supervisions Masters 3 74 PhD 1 7 \n Number of students currently supervising/co-supervising Total number of student supervisions/co-supervisions \n Number of students currently supervising/co-supervising Total number of student supervisions/co-supervisions \n \n Number of students currently supervising/co-supervising \n Total number of student supervisions/co-supervisions \n Masters 3 74 PhD 1 7 \n Masters 3 74 \n Masters \n 3 \n 74 \n PhD 1 7 \n PhD \n 1 \n 7 \n Recent/key publications\n (*Co-authored with student) \n Woudsma C., (2020), Gig Workers in Canada\u2019s Courier Industry, report prepared for Employment and Social Development Canada, p. 1-42, Ottawa Woudsma C., (2020), Disrupting Stuff: Material Flows in the Platform City, In Zwick A, and Spicer Z., (eds), The Platform Economy and the City: Urban Peril and Promise in the New Digital Economy, Forthcoming *Woudsma, C.G., Jakubicek, P., (2020) Logistics land use patterns in metropolitan Canada, Journal of Transport Geography, Volume 88, p 1 - 10 Woudsma C.

To efficiently interact with the environment, the brain must make sense of this converging information in order to form a reliable and accurate percept with which to guide decision-making and behaviour. I am the Director of the Multisensory Brain and Cognition Lab, which seeks to determine how the brain integrates multisensory information. As a cognitive and systems neuroscientist, I investigate how multisensory processing impacts spatial and temporal perception, decision-making and human movement in real, virtual and artificial intelligence created environments. My research has helped to identify key markers of disease and test the efficacy of therapeutic and rehabilitation efforts to combat disorientation, especially in differently abled populations. My discoveries about vestibular (balance) perception have also led to practical applications in the calibration of virtual reality environments and motion simulators.

This is accomplished by studying the conductance of oxygen across multiple physiological systems (pulmonary, cardiac and muscle) and their interaction. Using concepts of homeostasis, regulation, feedback, redundancy and acclimatization/adaptation, my laboratory builds upon reductionists findings to understand whole-body physiology.

We use medical imaging technologies to explore bone and muscle responses to activity or neurologic impairment, and evaluate new methods for image analysis. We conduct epidemiologic studies to inform fracture risk assessment algorithms. We conduct clinical trials to investigate the effects of exercise interventions for reducing fracture risk in high risk individuals. We lead knowledge dissemination and translation activities, and implementation studies to move research on exercise for older adults into practice. For example, our research team has worked with Osteoporosis Canada to develop BoneFit, a two-day workshop for physiotherapists and kinesiologists on appropriate assessment and exercise prescription for individuals with osteoporosis. We also led the development of the Too Fit To Fracture Exercise and Physical Activity Recommendations for Individuals with Osteoporosis.

We use medical imaging technologies to explore bone and muscle responses to activity or neurologic impairment, and evaluate new methods for image analysis. We conduct epidemiologic studies to inform fracture risk assessment algorithms. We conduct clinical trials to investigate the effects of exercise interventions for reducing fracture risk in high risk individuals. We lead knowledge dissemination and translation activities, and implementation studies to move research on exercise for older adults into practice. For example, our research team has worked with Osteoporosis Canada to develop BoneFit, a two-day workshop for physiotherapists and kinesiologists on appropriate assessment and exercise prescription for individuals with osteoporosis. We also led the development of the Too Fit To Fracture Exercise and Physical Activity Recommendations for Individuals with Osteoporosis.

Within this framework, my research over the next five years will focus on three categories: 1) fall-related tissue trauma including hip fractures, spinal cord injuries, and traumatic brain injuries; 2) balance and mobility issues that could increase the risk of fall-related injuries; and 3) workplace musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD). For the former I will use experimental paradigms including human volunteers, mechanical impact simulators (e.g. drop towers), and mathematical models to measure and predict the loads applied to the body during falls, and the protective capacity of a range of protective devices. Age-related changes in balance and mobility will be investigated during a range of activities, with particularly emphasis on responses to dynamic perturbations. The work related to WMSD will involve the measurement of age-related differences in exposures and/or tolerances to loads applied to the body at work, and the development of interventions that target specific age groups. This work will complement existing knowledge related to age-specific injury mechanisms and effective injury prevention across the lifespan.

Within this framework, my research over the next five years will focus on three categories: 1) fall-related tissue trauma including hip fractures, spinal cord injuries, and traumatic brain injuries; 2) balance and mobility issues that could increase the risk of fall-related injuries; and 3) workplace musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD). For the former I will use experimental paradigms including human volunteers, mechanical impact simulators (e.g. drop towers), and mathematical models to measure and predict the loads applied to the body during falls, and the protective capacity of a range of protective devices. Age-related changes in balance and mobility will be investigated during a range of activities, with particularly emphasis on responses to dynamic perturbations. The work related to WMSD will involve the measurement of age-related differences in exposures and/or tolerances to loads applied to the body at work, and the development of interventions that target specific age groups. This work will complement existing knowledge related to age-specific injury mechanisms and effective injury prevention across the lifespan.

We focus on the role of physical activity and complementary lifestyle strategies such as healthy eating, social engagement, and cognitive stimulation. We partner with people living with dementia, care partners, health care professionals, and community service providers as co-researchers to create accessible and effective supports and interventions. Recent projects developed strategies to improve the inclusion and participation of persons living with dementia and mild cognitive impairment in physical activity, healthy eating, and other community wellness programs and investigated the impact of combined exercise and cognitive training among persons at risk for dementia.

Dynamic changes in muscle mass have a vital role in physiological, metabolic and physical function in diverse populations ranging from healthy individuals to patients with chronic disease (including cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). There are numerous factors that can influence changes in muscle mass including nutrition and fitness capacity. My research focuses on the interrelationship between nutrition, exercise, body composition and the effects of these factors on muscle metabolism in healthy people as well as patients with cancer. The vast majority of cancer patients endure varying degrees of muscle loss at different periods of the disease time-course. The loss of muscle is thought to have a detrimental effect on survival, disease progression, immune function, as well as physical function. To better understand muscle wasting in cancer, my work identifies methodological approaches of body composition to precisely measure and characterize changes in muscle in cancer patients. My research program will further examine potential underlying mechanisms of this problem and develop rehabilitative approaches to counter, and potentially prevent, muscle loss by integrating concepts of nutrition, protein metabolism and muscle physiology.

Dynamic changes in muscle mass have a vital role in physiological, metabolic and physical function in diverse populations ranging from healthy individuals to patients with chronic disease (including cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). There are numerous factors that can influence changes in muscle mass including nutrition and fitness capacity. My research focuses on the interrelationship between nutrition, exercise, body composition and the effects of these factors on muscle metabolism in healthy people as well as patients with cancer. The vast majority of cancer patients endure varying degrees of muscle loss at different periods of the disease time-course. The loss of muscle is thought to have a detrimental effect on survival, disease progression, immune function, as well as physical function. To better understand muscle wasting in cancer, my work identifies methodological approaches of body composition to precisely measure and characterize changes in muscle in cancer patients. My research program will further examine potential underlying mechanisms of this problem and develop rehabilitative approaches to counter, and potentially prevent, muscle loss by integrating concepts of nutrition, protein metabolism and muscle physiology.

The goal of Theme 1 is advance the understanding of visuomotor integration during the performance of skillful movements in 3D space. The overarching hypothesis for this work is that binocular vision provides an essential input for the development and optimal performance of manipulation skills, which is based on predictive control mechanisms that require the knowledge of object properties. Experimental work includes studies with visually-normal children and adults, as well as people with abnormal binocular vision. Results from this work will help us develop assessment tools and training regimens to improve visuomotor coordination. Research in Theme 2 focuses on evaluating gaze behavior in pilots with different levels of expertise. The goal is to determine how gaze behaviour changes as a function of learning, and to use this information to develop predictive models of pilot competency. This research is conducted using eye tracking in a flight simulator with a team of scientists in the Aviation Research Cluster. Results will be used to advance and innovate aviation training by informing a competency based education model for pilot skill assessment. The goal of Theme 3 is to develop more sensitive and objective behavioral tests to improve concussion diagnosis and recovery monitoring following a sport-related head injury. Objective and sensitive screening measures for concussions are important in order to reduce the long-term consequences associated with repetitive head injury, such as early onset brain and behavior disorders Summary Role of normal binocular vision in the development of fine motor skills Neuroplasticity resulting from abnormal binocular vision due to amblyopia and/or strabismus Multisensory integration during performance of complex manipulation tasks Gaze behaviour in complex environments Innovative assessment of pilot competency Effect of mild traumatic brain injury and post-concussion syndrome on oculomotor and cognitive functions Environmental and genetic interactions Graduate supervision and student opportunities Research volunteer Undergraduate thesis MSc thesis Coursework interns PhD thesis Please email me to discuss current available opportunities.

Journal of Sport Sciences. 2016, 21:1-10 \nResearch interests\nWe are pursuing 3 main research themes in the Developmental Visuomotor Neuroscience Lab. The goal of Theme 1 is advance the understanding of visuomotor integration during the performance of skillful movements in 3D space. The overarching hypothesis for this work is that binocular vision provides an essential input for the development and optimal performance of manipulation skills, which is based on predictive control mechanisms that require the knowledge of object properties. Experimental work includes studies with visually-normal children and adults, as well as people with abnormal binocular vision. Results from this work will help us develop assessment tools and training regimens to improve visuomotor coordination.\nWe are pursuing 3 main research themes in the Developmental Visuomotor Neuroscience Lab.

The goal is to determine how gaze behaviour changes as a function of learning, and to use this information to develop predictive models of pilot competency. This research is conducted using eye tracking in a flight simulator with a team of scientists in the Aviation Research Cluster. Results will be used to advance and innovate aviation training by informing a competency based education model for pilot skill assessment.\nResearch in Theme 2 focuses on evaluating gaze behavior in pilots with different levels of expertise.
