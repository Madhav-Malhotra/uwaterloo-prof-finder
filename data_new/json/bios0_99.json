I have taught three dozen different undergraduate and graduate courses, but most often teach Shakespeare and English Renaissance poetry. My research focuses on the relationship between literature and history, particularly the histories of religion, politics, and education during the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation. My main contributions have come in two areas. The first is the study of religious poetry, from early Protestant psalm translations to John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost; my interests here include George Herbert, Fulke Greville, and the English metrical psalters, about each of which I have written three essays. The second is Shakespeare studies, where my work has explored problems of rhetorical expression in relation to conviction and religious belief. My first book, The Performance of Conviction, explores how rejecting the need for rhetorical artifice paradoxically became the rhetorical and literary means by which an early modern culture of conviction sought variously to reform, educate, serve, dominate, or abandon the world. My second book, Disciplinary Measures from the Metrical Psalm to Milton, argues that the Reformation attack on the disciplinary structures of the late medieval church significantly affected the way Herbert, Milton, and others understood the power of language \u2013 including poetry \u2013 to govern conduct and cure souls. In 2005 I co-organized the 17th Waterloo Conference on Elizabethan Theatre on the topic of Religion and Theatre, which led to the publication in 2009 of Shakespeare and Religious Change. I am now an organizer of the Shakespearean Theatre Conference, a collaboration between the University of Waterloo and the Stratford Festival that runs in Stratford in odd-numbered years.

As part of this project, I have led seminars at the Shakespeare Association of America conference and at the World Shakespeare Congress on how what is known in Shakespeare studies as \u201cthe turn to religion\u201d might be brought together with studies of Shakespeare\u2019s language. I am also involved with two editorial projects, the online Pulter Project (https://pulterproject.northwestern.edu/) and a three-volume Oxford edition of George Herbert's Complete Works. Areas of graduate supervision Renaissance & Reformation literature, including Shakespeare and Milton Poetry Literature & Rhetoric \nPhD, BerkeleyMA, TorontoBA, AlbertaExtension: 45124 Email: k2graham@uwaterloo.ca\n\n\nPhD, Berkeley\n\nMA, Toronto\n\nBA, Alberta\n\n\nExtension: 45124 Email: \n\nk2graham@uwaterloo.ca\nBiography\nI joined the Waterloo faculty in 2001, having taught previously at New Mexico State University, Dalhousie University, the University of Alberta, the University of Wyoming, and the University of California at Berkeley. I have taught three dozen different undergraduate and graduate courses, but most often teach Shakespeare and English Renaissance poetry.\nMy research focuses on the relationship between literature and history, particularly the histories of religion, politics, and education during the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation. My main contributions have come in two areas. The first is the study of religious poetry, from early Protestant psalm translations to John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost; my interests here include George Herbert, Fulke Greville, and the English metrical psalters, about each of which I have written three essays. The second is Shakespeare studies, where my work has explored problems of rhetorical expression in relation to conviction and religious belief.\nParadise Lost\nMy first book, The Performance of Conviction, explores how rejecting the need for rhetorical artifice paradoxically became the rhetorical and literary means by which an early modern culture of conviction sought variously to reform, educate, serve, dominate, or abandon the world. My second book, Disciplinary Measures from the Metrical Psalm to Milton, argues that the Reformation attack on the disciplinary structures of the late medieval church significantly affected the way Herbert, Milton, and others understood the power of language \u2013 including poetry \u2013 to govern conduct and cure souls.\nThe Performance of Conviction\nDisciplinary Measures from the Metrical Psalm to Milton\nIn 2005 I co-organized the 17th Waterloo Conference on Elizabethan Theatre on the topic of Religion and Theatre, which led to the publication in 2009 of Shakespeare and Religious Change. I am now an organizer of the Shakespearean Theatre Conference, a collaboration between the University of Waterloo and the Stratford Festival that runs in Stratford in odd-numbered years.

With BA in hand and 6 terrific workterms at IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and the uWaterloo archives on my resume, I moved down the highway to the University of Guelph, spending a few years as a designer and writer in the Public Relations & Communications unit there before succumbing again to the lure of scholarship. When my thesis supervisor invited me to help collect materials for the theatre archives at Guelph, I found myself literally stopped in my tracks by the experience of holding memory in my hands. I spent the rest of grad school in the climate-controlled conditions of the archives, exploring how and why history preserves some authors, plays, and literary works while others disappear. My particular interest in mapping the networks of production has brought me back into the world of digital humanities, where I\u2019m working on a project to create an enriched online biobibliographical resource around Canadian women playwrights. I spent several years juggling freelance work as a writer, document designer, editor, and indexer with teaching writing, communications, English, Drama, and Theatre courses at Guelph, Guelph-Humber, and St. Jerome\u2019s before coming to Waterloo to co-ordinate the extended learning program.

My original academic speciality was music theory and history, but in 1981, after a brief stint as an apprentice harpsichord maker, I went to England to do graduate work in literature.

These critiques have been made in linguistics, in writing studies, and in the analytic philosophy of language, but they have been developed in almost complete ignorance of one another. My task is to start some kind of dialogue among them, in the interest of a theory of language with a broader and more comprehensive reach than those mortgaged to traditional theories of meaning. I am also beginning a course of research on the \u2018cultures of populism\u2019. I\u2019m interested in how mass cultural forms (film, video, television, games, etc.) construct an organize a sense of \u2018the people\u2019 and of what it means to be \u2018ordinary\u2019, which then undergirds populist appeals in the political sphere. Since spring of 2020, I have been convening a reading group on Games and Narrative, under the auspices of the Games Institute. The group, together with other members of the GI, now organises an annual International Conference on Games and Narrative.

After one decade out west, I am now in my second back on the campus of UWaterloo, where I enjoy teaching undergraduate courses ranging from introductions to literature and literary theory and the survey of British literature to upper-level courses on pre-modern rhetoric, Chaucer, and medieval literature.

The title of my most recent book, Rationality Is \u2026 The Essence of Literary Theory (May 2022), invites two different interpretations. For many, the essence of literary theory is the unmasking and redescription of rationality in other terms. Put ironically, rationality is male; rationality is white; rationality is repression\u2026. The book\u2019s title can also be read in a second way. On this reading, rationality itself is the essence of literary theory and central to literature, art, and society. Certain conceptions of what it entails can be problematic \u2013 the critique in the first way of reading the title remains relevant. Yet one can affirm rationality as integral to human flourishing, including the processes of creating, analyzing, and enjoying literature, art, and culture. My second book about Chaucer\u2019s poetry, The Fellowship of the Beatific Vision (2016), concerns a basic human question, How do we overcome tyranny? The symbolic pilgrim fellowship in The Canterbury Tales embodies the answer. Chaucer aligns himself with that other great poet-theologian of the Middle Ages, Dante, as a Christian humanist. He recognizes in art a fragile opportunity: not to reduce reality to a set of dogmatic propositions, but instead to participate in an ever-deepening mystery. Chaucer celebrates the way in which all human activity, even the most fraught of human interactions, ultimately bears witness to a created reality that resonates with a Word from God. My early work, including Chaucer on Love, Knowledge, and Sight (1995) and articles on French and other medieval literature, explored relational aspects of knowing in terms of the motif of sight. I have been interested in the ways in which Chaucer in particular complicates our understanding of knowledge, love, and belief. This interest developed into an exploration of the situatedness and self-knowledge involved in all attempts to make sense of things, not least those flying under the banner of humanism. I articulated some of these ideas in an introductory way in a co-authored book, The Passionate Intellect (2006). I have also written on literature and poetry for the Zondervan Dictionary of Christian Spirituality and, more recently, for The Chaucer Encyclopedia.

My main project is a cultural history of love and reason and the tension between them. Literature, art, and philosophy wrestle with an ambivalent reception of Plato\u2019s picture of reason as a charioteer controlling the horses of the passions and appetites, which are irrational, the Stoic conviction that the soul is entirely rational and all emotions derive from faulty judgements, and the Christian assimilation of reason to love.

The title of my most recent book, Rationality Is \u2026 The Essence of Literary Theory (May 2022), invites two different interpretations. For many, the essence of literary theory is the unmasking and redescription of rationality in other terms. Put ironically, rationality is male; rationality is white; rationality is repression\u2026. The book\u2019s title can also be read in a second way. On this reading, rationality itself is the essence of literary theory and central to literature, art, and society. Certain conceptions of what it entails can be problematic \u2013 the critique in the first way of reading the title remains relevant. Yet one can affirm rationality as integral to human flourishing, including the processes of creating, analyzing, and enjoying literature, art, and culture.\nI work at the intersections of literature, art, and intellectual history.

The symbolic pilgrim fellowship in The Canterbury Tales embodies the answer. Chaucer aligns himself with that other great poet-theologian of the Middle Ages, Dante, as a Christian humanist. He recognizes in art a fragile opportunity: not to reduce reality to a set of dogmatic propositions, but instead to participate in an ever-deepening mystery. Chaucer celebrates the way in which all human activity, even the most fraught of human interactions, ultimately bears witness to a created reality that resonates with a Word from God. \nMy second book about Chaucer\u2019s poetry, The Fellowship of the Beatific Vision (2016), concerns a basic human question, How do we overcome tyranny?

I have been interested in the ways in which Chaucer in particular complicates our understanding of knowledge, love, and belief. This interest developed into an exploration of the situatedness and self-knowledge involved in all attempts to make sense of things, not least those flying under the banner of humanism. I articulated some of these ideas in an introductory way in a co-authored book, The Passionate Intellect (2006). I have also written on literature and poetry for the Zondervan Dictionary of Christian Spirituality and, more recently, for The Chaucer Encyclopedia.\nMy early work, including Chaucer on Love, Knowledge, and Sight (1995) and articles on French and other medieval literature, explored relational aspects of knowing in terms of the motif of sight.

My family moved to Waterloo when I was eight so that my mother could attend Renison College, and I have many early memories of the University of Waterloo campus: sitting beside the creek, visiting the Porter library, and even tagging along to a lecture. I was hooked. As an undergraduate, I enrolled at St. Jerome\u2019s, and was profoundly influenced by my English courses on the main campus as well as across the creek. In particular, the courses that I took with Professor Katherine Acheson, which featured close readings of early modern writers such as Shakespeare and Milton, illuminated the rich possibilities available in the study of early modern literature and culture. At the same time, I nurtured an interest in language and language theory, developed in courses such as linguistics and semiotics. A reading course on Hamlet that combined language theory with literary analysis provided my moment of epiphany, and after completing an MA degree at York University, I arrived at the University of Toronto to pursue graduate work in linguistic approaches to Shakespeare. My dissertation focused on easily overlooked details of Shakespeare\u2019s language to explore how Shakespeare\u2019s speakers situate themselves and negotiate their identities in their language. My subsequent work as a \u200bSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University examined interconnections among gender, the language of time, and notions of futurity in Shakespeare\u2019s late plays. Most recently, I have been at work on a project that that considers Shakespeare\u2019s language in the broader cultural and linguistic climate of early modern England, with a particular emphasis on the rapid changes underway in the English language during Shakespeare\u2019s lifetime.

My family moved to Waterloo when I was eight so that my mother could attend Renison College, and I have many early memories of the University of Waterloo campus: sitting beside the creek, visiting the Porter library, and even tagging along to a lecture. I was hooked. As an undergraduate, I enrolled at St. Jerome\u2019s, and was profoundly influenced by my English courses on the main campus as well as across the creek. In particular, the courses that I took with Professor Katherine Acheson, which featured close readings of early modern writers such as Shakespeare and Milton, illuminated the rich possibilities available in the study of early modern literature and culture. At the same time, I nurtured an interest in language and language theory, developed in courses such as linguistics and semiotics. A reading course on Hamlet that combined language theory with literary analysis provided my moment of epiphany, and after completing an MA degree at York University, I arrived at the University of Toronto to pursue graduate work in linguistic approaches to Shakespeare. My dissertation focused on easily overlooked details of Shakespeare\u2019s language to explore how Shakespeare\u2019s speakers situate themselves and negotiate their identities in their language. My subsequent work as a \u200bSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University examined interconnections among gender, the language of time, and notions of futurity in Shakespeare\u2019s late plays. Most recently, I have been at work on a project that that considers Shakespeare\u2019s language in the broader cultural and linguistic climate of early modern England, with a particular emphasis on the rapid changes underway in the English language during Shakespeare\u2019s lifetime. Now, back in Waterloo and teaching Shakespeare at St. Jerome\u2019s, I feel that I have truly come home. Selected publications Shakespeare\u2019s Common Language.

I also think that this desire to escape was fundamentally a protest against heteronormativity, though I didn\u2019t know it at the time. After receiving my Ph.D. at Princeton University, working on H\u00f6lderlin and Novalis, I took a position at the University of North Carolina, where I worked 25 years, first in German and then jointly in Comparative Literature. After receiving tenure, I ventured further afield in my research and published an article on E.T.A. Hoffmann\u2019s story, \u201cThe Sandman\u201d and David Lynch\u2019s Blue Velvet. It started an exploration into ever new areas of research, a pattern that has characterized my entire academic life as a dilettante. Working more on film (co-mingled with queer theory), I published The Queer German Cinema in 2000.

Pursuing my passions further (I am the owner of two lovely whippets) I started working in the area of animal studies and came out in 2006 with Melancholia\u2019s Dog: Reflections on Our Animal Kinship.

Around 1800 scientists, philosophers, and poets alike believed in a life force uniting all of nature. In response to the eighteenth-century classification of species and mechanistic view of nature, the Romantics envisaged a dynamic harmonic symbiosis with nature. Although homeopathy has enjoyed a vibrant afterlife up to our present day, its intellectual, indeed poetic, groundings have been largely forgotten. I investigate how authors as Goethe and Novalis underscore the importance of the literary field in this momentous chapter to the history of science and medicine. As an outgrowth of this research, I also investigate how the homeopathic anamnesis and repertoires influence the poetry of the main female author of 19th-century Germany, Annette von Droste-H\u00fclshoff, who consulted a homeopath for over a decade.

Around 1800 scientists, philosophers, and poets alike believed in a life force uniting all of nature. In response to the eighteenth-century classification of species and mechanistic view of nature, the Romantics envisaged a dynamic harmonic symbiosis with nature. Although homeopathy has enjoyed a vibrant afterlife up to our present day, its intellectual, indeed poetic, groundings have been largely forgotten. I investigate how authors as Goethe and Novalis underscore the importance of the literary field in this momentous chapter to the history of science and medicine. As an outgrowth of this research, I also investigate how the homeopathic anamnesis and repertoires influence the poetry of the main female author of 19th-century Germany, Annette von Droste-H\u00fclshoff, who consulted a homeopath for over a decade.

I also think that this desire to escape was fundamentally a protest against heteronormativity, though I didn\u2019t know it at the time. After receiving my Ph.D. at Princeton University, working on H\u00f6lderlin and Novalis, I took a position at the University of North Carolina, where I worked 25 years, first in German and then jointly in Comparative Literature. After receiving tenure, I ventured further afield in my research and published an article on E.T.A. Hoffmann\u2019s story, \u201cThe Sandman\u201d and David Lynch\u2019s Blue Velvet. It started an exploration into ever new areas of research, a pattern that has characterized my entire academic life as a dilettante. Working more on film (co-mingled with queer theory), I published The Queer German Cinema in 2000. It was preceded in 1996 by an another major publication\u2014the first on queer issues in 18th-century literature and on the topic of what I like to term \u201chomoaesthetics\u201d\u2014Outing Goethe and His Age, a volume that I edited. Pursuing my passions further (I am the owner of two lovely whippets) I started working in the area of animal studies and came out in 2006 with Melancholia\u2019s Dog: Reflections on Our Animal Kinship. Along the way, I have had guest professorships teaching a semester each at Princeton University, Rutgers University, and the University of Minnesota. I moved back to Canada in 2008 to escape Bush\u2019s regime and assumed a position at uWaterloo in the Department of Germanic and Slavic Studies. Here I helped to set up the Fine Arts major in Visual Culture and every fall teach a large first-year film class on contemporary Global Cinema. I lead a research group on \u201cPoetics and Nature circa 1800\u201d for the Waterloo Centre for German Studies. As an amateur herbalist I became interested in homeopathy and started researching its origins in German Romantic medicine, life sciences, and philosophy.

Around 1800 scientists, philosophers, and poets alike believed in a life force uniting all of nature. In response to the eighteenth-century classification of species and mechanistic view of nature, the Romantics envisaged a dynamic harmonic symbiosis with nature. Although homeopathy has enjoyed a vibrant afterlife up to our present day, its intellectual, indeed poetic, groundings have been largely forgotten. I investigate how authors as Goethe and Novalis underscore the importance of the literary field in this momentous chapter to the history of science and medicine. As an outgrowth of this research, I also investigate how the homeopathic anamnesis and repertoires influence the poetry of the main female author of 19th-century Germany, Annette von Droste-H\u00fclshoff, who consulted a homeopath for over a decade.\nth\nAreas of graduate supervision\nCinema studies Queer studies Animal studies History of medicine Psychoanalytic approaches to literature and film \nCinema studies\nQueer studies\nAnimal studies\nHistory of medicine\nPsychoanalytic approaches to literature and film\nI have directed dissertations on such topics as \u201cChristopher Nolan and the art of anamorphosis,\u201d \"The representation of the divine in Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin and his contemporaries,\u201d \u201cNarrative strategies in the contemporary novel of the undead,\u201d \u201cReforming the fat woman: the narrative encoding of size in film,\u201d \u201cGenerational conflict in German terrorist cinema,\u201d and \u201cVisual violence and the loss of self in G\u00fcnderrode, H\u00f6lderlin und Fichte.\u201d I co-supervise uWaterloo English department dissertations.

My teaching has taken many interesting turns. Naturally, I have taught in a variety of literature and writing courses, and I have embraced the chance to teach courses about the history and structure of English.

My most recent undertaking is to explore how communications and writing pedagogy can more accurately describe, measure, and report the outcomes of such teaching to demonstrate significant shifts in students\u2019 communications skill sets.\nAreas of Expertise\nTranslation theory Structure of the English language Rhetoric Communications in Engineering and the sciences \nTranslation theory\nStructure of the English language\nRhetoric\nCommunications in Engineering and the sciences\nAffiliation: University of Waterloo\nAffiliation: \nUniversity of Waterloo\nUniversity of Waterloo\n\n\n"}, {"profile": "https://experts.uwaterloo.ca/lamees-alethari", "name": "Lamees Al Ethari", "position": "Lecturer  Faculty of Arts Department of English Language and Literature ", "email": "lalethari@uwaterloo.ca", "expertise": ["Academic writing", "Creative writing", "Immigration and identity", "Iraqi North American women\u2019s life narratives", "Narrative of migrant Iraqi women in the diaspora", "War", "Writings of migrant Iraqi women in the diaspora"], "bio": " Continuing LecturerPhD, University of Waterloo Master of Arts, Kansas State University Master of Arts, University of Baghdad Bachelor of Arts, Al-Moman University College Extension: x43029Email: lalethari@uwaterloo.ca Biography My academic journey began in Baghdad, Iraq as an English language student at a small teacher\u2019s college, where I learned to teach English language and literature to non-native English speakers.

Not only did I take ENGL 316: Canadian Drama at St. Jerome's from Dr. Ted McGee as I was deciding if I'd pursue graduate work, but also my first term as a graduate student brought me to St. Jerome's for a course in Canadian Poetry. Much of my current work both as a researcher and a teacher has been inspired by those early experiences. If I had to pick, I\u2019d say poetry is my favourite genre to study (and to write), but my interests tend to be rather broad. My M.A. thesis dealt with representations of the supernatural in Canadian Children\u2019s Literature (likely a bit inspired by the popularity of The X-files, I\u2019m afraid). I\u2019m artistic, with an undergraduate minor in Fine Arts, so my work in literary studies often deals with intersections between the visual arts and literature. For instance, my Ph.D. dissertation focussed on the use of visual experimentation by poets of the Caribbean diaspora (e.g., Kamau Brathwaite, Claire Harris, and M. NourbeSe Philip). Furthermore, my current project Artful (Un)Belonging considers how references to and/or the incorporation of the visual arts is deployed in contemporary Canadian Literature as a means of interrogating experiences of (un)belonging. I also very much value Canadian literature as something we live in the midst of; it surrounds us if we let it. As co-organizer of St. Jerome\u2019s Reading Series, which brings Canadian writers to campus for readings, I hope to play a part in letting Canadian literature have a recognized and appreciated place among us.

Namely, it has considered how writers use the formal features of their texts to manage both their own and their audience\u2019s access to, and thereby relationships with, the events and people being represented. I have also developed a focus that considers literary representations of acts of eating. This work conceives of representation of eating as explorations of power systems and dynamics. My primary project at present is one that lets me combine my interests in literary studies and the fine arts. In this project, I am exploring how contemporary Canadian writers use the visual arts to explore experiences of (un)belonging. I theorize that intersections between the visual and literary arts function to interrogate the efficacies of showing rather than, or in addition to, telling. As deployed by various authors, the visual arts become an alternate mode of communication that allows for the expression of difficult subjects for which words may fail. This project has begun with a focus on such writers as Dionne Brand, Roy Kiyooka, Fred Wah, George Elliott Clarke, and Kim Barry Brunhuber.

If I had to pick, I\u2019d say poetry is my favourite genre to study (and to write), but my interests tend to be rather broad. My M.A. thesis dealt with representations of the supernatural in Canadian Children\u2019s Literature (likely a bit inspired by the popularity of The X-files, I\u2019m afraid). I\u2019m artistic, with an undergraduate minor in Fine Arts, so my work in literary studies often deals with intersections between the visual arts and literature. For instance, my Ph.D. dissertation focussed on the use of visual experimentation by poets of the Caribbean diaspora (e.g., Kamau Brathwaite, Claire Harris, and M. NourbeSe Philip). Furthermore, my current project Artful (Un)Belonging considers how references to and/or the incorporation of the visual arts is deployed in contemporary Canadian Literature as a means of interrogating experiences of (un)belonging.

Namely, it has considered how writers use the formal features of their texts to manage both their own and their audience\u2019s access to, and thereby relationships with, the events and people being represented. I have also developed a focus that considers literary representations of acts of eating. This work conceives of representation of eating as explorations of power systems and dynamics. My primary project at present is one that lets me combine my interests in literary studies and the fine arts. In this project, I am exploring how contemporary Canadian writers use the visual arts to explore experiences of (un)belonging. I theorize that intersections between the visual and literary arts function to interrogate the efficacies of showing rather than, or in addition to, telling. As deployed by various authors, the visual arts become an alternate mode of communication that allows for the expression of difficult subjects for which words may fail. This project has begun with a focus on such writers as Dionne Brand, Roy Kiyooka, Fred Wah, George Elliott Clarke, and Kim Barry Brunhuber.

Not only did I take ENGL 316: Canadian Drama at St. Jerome's from Dr. Ted McGee as I was deciding if I'd pursue graduate work, but also my first term as a graduate student brought me to St. Jerome's for a course in Canadian Poetry. Much of my current work both as a researcher and a teacher has been inspired by those early experiences. \nComing to St. Jerome's as their specialist in Postcolonial and Canadian Literature represents a bit of a homecoming for me.

My M.A. thesis dealt with representations of the supernatural in Canadian Children\u2019s Literature (likely a bit inspired by the popularity of The X-files, I\u2019m afraid). I\u2019m artistic, with an undergraduate minor in Fine Arts, so my work in literary studies often deals with intersections between the visual arts and literature. For instance, my Ph.D. dissertation focussed on the use of visual experimentation by poets of the Caribbean diaspora (e.g., Kamau Brathwaite, Claire Harris, and M. NourbeSe Philip). Furthermore, my current project Artful (Un)Belonging considers how references to and/or the incorporation of the visual arts is deployed in contemporary Canadian Literature as a means of interrogating experiences of (un)belonging. I also very much value Canadian literature as something we live in the midst of; it surrounds us if we let it. As co-organizer of St. Jerome\u2019s Reading Series, which brings Canadian writers to campus for readings, I hope to play a part in letting Canadian literature have a recognized and appreciated place among us.\nIf I had to pick, I\u2019d say poetry is my favourite genre to study (and to write), but my interests tend to be rather broad.

Prior to my arrival at the University of Waterloo, I directed the writing centre and taught at Siena College in Loudonville New York (1996-2000); served as an associate professor, director of the writing centre, and finally director of the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota (2000-2007); and from 2007 - 2013 was an associate professor of English at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I took up my post at the University of Waterloo in July 2013. My primary areas of interest lie in the fields of Rhetoric and Writing Studies. More specifically, however, within that field I am interested in the intersections between critical race, labor, and rhetoric studies, in narrative and performativity, and in critical pedagogy. I also write and publish in the area of writing centre studies. I am a frequent keynote speaker and consultant to colleges and universities across the US on institutional racism and anti-racist organizing. At both the undergraduate and graduate levels, I teach with the aim of challenging students to notice, wonder at, and engage critically the power not only of language itself, but of particular rhetorical modes and strategies for creating, sustaining, and transforming our relations with and for one another. I believe, in other words, that the study of writing and rhetoric is also necessarily the study of how human relations are forged in and through language\u2014shaped, enabled, and constrained through our representations of ourselves, of others, and of that which constitutes knowledge within particular contexts or communities. The study of rhetoric should, I think, engage all of us in the study not only of what is said and how, but also toward what ends and for whose benefit. I hope students leave my courses with an expanded sense of their intellectual and rhetorical antecedents as well as with a much greater sense of their own contingency: their interdependence and the mutuality of their needs and interests across disparate visible and invisible identities and social and lived subjectivities. Furthermore, I hope that students leave my courses with a greatly enlarged sense of their own agency and their responsibility as scholars, rhetoricians and writers\u2014as citizens of the world\u2014to those with whom we share the world as well as those who will come after. When I am not in my office, the classroom, or a meeting I can most frequently be found in an ice rink somewhere in North America watching a hockey game. Alternatively, you might check the nearest lake for I do love any activity that has to do with water\u2014frozen or not. And, if all else fails, look for me in my garden.

Grant-in-Aid, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Absolute Equality: Rhetorics of Race in the Industrial Workers Movement, 2011-2012 Current research My current research, funded by a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, centers on the radical precedents of postracialism in American political and civic rhetoric. I am particularly interested in appeals for and fault-lines within calls for transracial solidarity made to white workers and workers of color by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), as well as by socialist and communist organizers and activists during the early twentieth century in the U.S. and Canada. My current focus is on the historical deployments of the metaphor of colourblindness for racial justice within and beyond the radical labour and Leftist political movements of North America during the 20th century.

At both the undergraduate and graduate levels, I teach with the aim of challenging students to notice, wonder at, and engage critically the power not only of language itself, but of particular rhetorical modes and strategies for creating, sustaining, and transforming our relations with and for one another. I believe, in other words, that the study of writing and rhetoric is also necessarily the study of how human relations are forged in and through language\u2014shaped, enabled, and constrained through our representations of ourselves, of others, and of that which constitutes knowledge within particular contexts or communities. The study of rhetoric should, I think, engage all of us in the study not only of what is said and how, but also toward what ends and for whose benefit. I hope students leave my courses with an expanded sense of their intellectual and rhetorical antecedents as well as with a much greater sense of their own contingency: their interdependence and the mutuality of their needs and interests across disparate visible and invisible identities and social and lived subjectivities. Furthermore, I hope that students leave my courses with a greatly enlarged sense of their own agency and their responsibility as scholars, rhetoricians and writers\u2014as citizens of the world\u2014to those with whom we share the world as well as those who will come after. When I am not in my office, the classroom, or a meeting I can most frequently be found in an ice rink somewhere in North America watching a hockey game. Alternatively, you might check the nearest lake for I do love any activity that has to do with water\u2014frozen or not. And, if all else fails, look for me in my garden.

Grant-in-Aid, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Absolute Equality: Rhetorics of Race in the Industrial Workers Movement, 2011-2012 Current research My current research, funded by a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, centers on the radical precedents of postracialism in American political and civic rhetoric. I am particularly interested in appeals for and fault-lines within calls for transracial solidarity made to white workers and workers of color by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), as well as by socialist and communist organizers and activists during the early twentieth century in the U.S. and Canada. My current focus is on the historical deployments of the metaphor of colourblindness for racial justice within and beyond the radical labour and Leftist political movements of North America during the 20th century.

Prior to my arrival at the University of Waterloo, I directed the writing centre and taught at Siena College in Loudonville New York (1996-2000); served as an associate professor, director of the writing centre, and finally director of the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota (2000-2007); and from 2007 - 2013 was an associate professor of English at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I took up my post at the University of Waterloo in July 2013. My primary areas of interest lie in the fields of Rhetoric and Writing Studies. More specifically, however, within that field I am interested in the intersections between critical race, labor, and rhetoric studies, in narrative and performativity, and in critical pedagogy. I also write and publish in the area of writing centre studies.

Areas of graduate supervision Cross-cultural and antiracist rhetorics Critical race theory and rhetoric Public rhetorics and social change Writing and writing centre theory, practice, and pedagogy \nPhD, University at AlbanyMA, Clarion University BFA, York University Extension: 47141 Email: fcondon@uwaterloo.caWebsite: https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/fcondon Biography I completed my BFA at York University in Theatre (Performing Arts, Honours), my MA at Clarion University of Pennsylvania, and my PhD at the University at Albany (State University of New York). Prior to my arrival at the University of Waterloo, I directed the writing centre and taught at Siena College in Loudonville New York (1996-2000); served as an associate professor, director of the writing centre, and finally director of the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota (2000-2007); and from 2007 - 2013 was an associate professor of English at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I took up my post at the University of Waterloo in July 2013. My primary areas of interest lie in the fields of Rhetoric and Writing Studies. More specifically, however, within that field I am interested in the intersections between critical race, labor, and rhetoric studies, in narrative and performativity, and in critical pedagogy. I also write and publish in the area of writing centre studies. I am a frequent keynote speaker and consultant to colleges and universities across the US on institutional racism and anti-racist organizing. At both the undergraduate and graduate levels, I teach with the aim of challenging students to notice, wonder at, and engage critically the power not only of language itself, but of particular rhetorical modes and strategies for creating, sustaining, and transforming our relations with and for one another. I believe, in other words, that the study of writing and rhetoric is also necessarily the study of how human relations are forged in and through language\u2014shaped, enabled, and constrained through our representations of ourselves, of others, and of that which constitutes knowledge within particular contexts or communities. The study of rhetoric should, I think, engage all of us in the study not only of what is said and how, but also toward what ends and for whose benefit. I hope students leave my courses with an expanded sense of their intellectual and rhetorical antecedents as well as with a much greater sense of their own contingency: their interdependence and the mutuality of their needs and interests across disparate visible and invisible identities and social and lived subjectivities. Furthermore, I hope that students leave my courses with a greatly enlarged sense of their own agency and their responsibility as scholars, rhetoricians and writers\u2014as citizens of the world\u2014to those with whom we share the world as well as those who will come after. When I am not in my office, the classroom, or a meeting I can most frequently be found in an ice rink somewhere in North America watching a hockey game. Alternatively, you might check the nearest lake for I do love any activity that has to do with water\u2014frozen or not. And, if all else fails, look for me in my garden.

Funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. Awarded for 2014 \u2013 2017: $91,445. Grant-in-Aid, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Absolute Equality: Rhetorics of Race in the Industrial Workers Movement, 2011-2012 Current research My current research, funded by a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, centers on the radical precedents of postracialism in American political and civic rhetoric. I am particularly interested in appeals for and fault-lines within calls for transracial solidarity made to white workers and workers of color by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), as well as by socialist and communist organizers and activists during the early twentieth century in the U.S. and Canada. My current focus is on the historical deployments of the metaphor of colourblindness for racial justice within and beyond the radical labour and Leftist political movements of North America during the 20th century. Knowledge Mobilization Founding member: The Aptly Outspoken! Collective: committed to anti-racist education, anti-racist pedagogy and anti-racist activism focused on naming, addressing, and dismantling the ongoing fatal racial dynamics, racism, and white supremacy in Canada and the US. The Aptly Outspoken! Collective organized in the wake of the murder of George Floyd.

I am particularly interested in appeals for and fault-lines within calls for transracial solidarity made to white workers and workers of color by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), as well as by socialist and communist organizers and activists during the early twentieth century in the U.S. and Canada. My current focus is on the historical deployments of the metaphor of colourblindness for racial justice within and beyond the radical labour and Leftist political movements of North America during the 20th century.

As an undergraduate I fell in love with medieval literature, especially Old English, and had already long been more than half in love with Romantic poetry, so I decided to do one graduate degree on each. My MA thesis was on the medieval dream visions \u201cDream of the Rood\u201d and \u201cPearl\u201d. I received a Commonwealth Scholarship and continued to live in the mystical past by pursuing my PhD at King's College, Cambridge, where I was an acolyte in the beautiful Gothic chapel. I wrote my dissertation on William Blake\u2019s central image, the human body. My preoccupation with the strange ways Blake\u2019s mythological characters come into being, and his idiosyncratic treatment of musculature and posture in his visual art, led me to explore medical contexts: eighteenth-century midwifery writing and medical illustration. This area has been a rich vein for my research ever since, as I have pursued representations of reproduction in women\u2019s poetry and medical texts, and gender and sexuality in Blake, most recently branching out (so to speak) into the sex lives of plants in the work of Erasmus Darwin (for whose Economy of Vegetation Blake produced some pretty impressive engravings). Before coming to Waterloo in 2004, I was Assistant Professor at Butler University in Indiana, and before that, Instructor at Auburn University in Alabama. I taught a range of literature and writing courses, and enjoyed the opportunity to include a broad range of texts, from the Vedas to The Getaway. At St Jerome\u2019s I\u2019m delighted to continue to teach a wide variety of material in courses such as Sex and Marriage in Literature, Editing Literary Works, and the Jane Austen course, as well as Literature of the Romantic Period. I\u2019ve taught graduate courses, on Blake and on Romanticism, botany and medicine, am on the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century graduate examination committees, and supervise graduate students working on Romantic-era texts and/or the relations between gender, sexuality, medicine, and writing. I also get to indulge my love of Canadian literature here, as I\u2019m a poetry editor for The New Quarterly, and I co-organize the Canada Council-funded Reading Series at St. Jerome\u2019s.

I have been co-editing a number of essay collections with colleagues in the United Kingdom and Japan, on a variety of topics. The latest ones in progress are Austen in Asia (co-edited with Kimiyo Ogawa) and Blake Sees Jesus (another one from the dynamic duo, me and Helen Bruder). I\u2019m also co-editor of two book series for Palgrave Macmillan: Pop Music, Culture and Identity (with Steve Clark and Jason Whittaker) and Asia-Pacific and Literature in English (with Shun-Liang Chao, Steve Clark, Alex Watson, and Laurence Williams). My long-term project, slowly but surely approaching completion, is a digital edition of Erasmus Darwin\u2019s The Loves of the Plants, with former students Elizabeth Bernath and Alana Rigby.

As an undergraduate I fell in love with medieval literature, especially Old English, and had already long been more than half in love with Romantic poetry, so I decided to do one graduate degree on each. My MA thesis was on the medieval dream visions \u201cDream of the Rood\u201d and \u201cPearl\u201d. I received a Commonwealth Scholarship and continued to live in the mystical past by pursuing my PhD at King's College, Cambridge, where I was an acolyte in the beautiful Gothic chapel. I wrote my dissertation on William Blake\u2019s central image, the human body. My preoccupation with the strange ways Blake\u2019s mythological characters come into being, and his idiosyncratic treatment of musculature and posture in his visual art, led me to explore medical contexts: eighteenth-century midwifery writing and medical illustration. This area has been a rich vein for my research ever since, as I have pursued representations of reproduction in women\u2019s poetry and medical texts, and gender and sexuality in Blake, most recently branching out (so to speak) into the sex lives of plants in the work of Erasmus Darwin (for whose Economy of Vegetation Blake produced some pretty impressive engravings). Before coming to Waterloo in 2004, I was Assistant Professor at Butler University in Indiana, and before that, Instructor at Auburn University in Alabama. I taught a range of literature and writing courses, and enjoyed the opportunity to include a broad range of texts, from the Vedas to The Getaway. At St Jerome\u2019s I\u2019m delighted to continue to teach a wide variety of material in courses such as Sex and Marriage in Literature, Editing Literary Works, and the Jane Austen course, as well as Literature of the Romantic Period. I\u2019ve taught graduate courses, on Blake and on Romanticism, botany and medicine, am on the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century graduate examination committees, and supervise graduate students working on Romantic-era texts and/or the relations between gender, sexuality, medicine, and writing. I also get to indulge my love of Canadian literature here, as I\u2019m a poetry editor for The New Quarterly, and I co-organize the Canada Council-funded Reading Series at St. Jerome\u2019s.

As an undergraduate I fell in love with medieval literature, especially Old English, and had already long been more than half in love with Romantic poetry, so I decided to do one graduate degree on each. My MA thesis was on the medieval dream visions \u201cDream of the Rood\u201d and \u201cPearl\u201d. I received a Commonwealth Scholarship and continued to live in the mystical past by pursuing my PhD at King's College, Cambridge, where I was an acolyte in the beautiful Gothic chapel. I wrote my dissertation on William Blake\u2019s central image, the human body. My preoccupation with the strange ways Blake\u2019s mythological characters come into being, and his idiosyncratic treatment of musculature and posture in his visual art, led me to explore medical contexts: eighteenth-century midwifery writing and medical illustration. This area has been a rich vein for my research ever since, as I have pursued representations of reproduction in women\u2019s poetry and medical texts, and gender and sexuality in Blake, most recently branching out (so to speak) into the sex lives of plants in the work of Erasmus Darwin (for whose Economy of Vegetation Blake produced some pretty impressive engravings).\nEconomy of Vegetation\nBefore coming to Waterloo in 2004, I was Assistant Professor at Butler University in Indiana, and before that, Instructor at Auburn University in Alabama. I taught a range of literature and writing courses, and enjoyed the opportunity to include a broad range of texts, from the Vedas to The Getaway. At St Jerome\u2019s I\u2019m delighted to continue to teach a wide variety of material in courses such as Sex and Marriage in Literature, Editing Literary Works, and the Jane Austen course, as well as Literature of the Romantic Period. I\u2019ve taught graduate courses, on Blake and on Romanticism, botany and medicine, am on the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century graduate examination committees, and supervise graduate students working on Romantic-era texts and/or the relations between gender, sexuality, medicine, and writing. I also get to indulge my love of Canadian literature here, as I\u2019m a poetry editor for The New Quarterly, and I co-organize the Canada Council-funded Reading Series at St. Jerome\u2019s.\nThe Getaway\nThe New Quarterly\nSelected Publications\nBooks\nBeastly Blake, co-edited with Helen P.

As an anatomy lab instructor, I\u2019ve haunted the halls of the Winnipeg Health Sciences Centre morgue. As a public school teacher in Nunavut, I\u2019ve had polar bear for breakfast. As a technical communicator, I\u2019ve worked in web and document design and dabbled in Perl, shell scripts, and the now-obsolete ObjectStar database inquiry language. And, as an instructor at a number of postsecondary institutions, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of teaching everything from rhetorical theory to comics studies to literary non-fiction.\nI completed my PhD in English at the University of Waterloo, specializing in rhetorical theory (particularly intercultural and cross-cultural rhetoric) and American literature. I also have research and teaching interests in cross-cultural communication, professional writing, nonfiction prose studies, and visual rhetoric, including graphic narratives. I taught rhetoric and American literature for seven years at Laurentian University, and I\u2019m now delighted to be back at Waterloo teaching rhetoric and professional writing courses and coordinating and developing the department\u2019s graduate teaching assistants. I'm the past president of RhetCanada, the Canadian Society for the Study of Rhetoric.\nSelected publications\nSelected publications\n\"Rhetoric and the Reluctant Postnationalist.\" Rhetor 8.1 (2021): n. pag.

In short, this research seeks to reconcile the constraints of \u201cbig data\u201d planning approaches with the complex, sometimes intangible, and often messy processes of building vibrant and liveable communities and cities. \nResearch areas\nResearch areas\nUser Experience Design Content Strategy Urban Economic Development Cultural Scenes and Creative Cities Cultural Mapping \nUser Experience Design\nContent Strategy\nUrban Economic Development\nCultural Scenes and Creative Cities\nCultural Mapping\n \n \nAffiliation: University of Waterloo\nAffiliation: \nUniversity of Waterloo\nUniversity of Waterloo\n\n\n"}, {"profile": "https://experts.uwaterloo.ca/jay-dolmage", "name": "Jay Dolmage", "position": "Associate Professor Chair, College Composition and Communication Committee on Disability Issues  Faculty of Arts Department of English Language and Literature ", "email": "dolmage@uwaterloo.ca", "expertise": ["Accessibility", "Composition pedagogy", "Composition theory", "Disability rights", "Disability studies", "Rhetorical history", "Rhetorical theory and  history"], "bio": " Professor | Chair of EnglishPhD, Miami University of OhioMA, WindsorBA, British ColumbiaExtension: 41035 Office: HH 224 Email: dolmage@uwaterloo.ca For administrative inquiries: englishchair@uwaterloo.ca Biography I have a lovely partner named Heather, a dog named Bingo, and three hilarious children named Vern, Francine, and Murphy.

Current research I am currently beginning a large-scale collaborative project that seeks to empower survivors of institutionalization in Ontario to become authors of two print books, to narrate their experiences and perspectives for posterity, and to contribute to our ongoing collective memory. The project has been awarded funding as part of a class action lawsuit settlement against the Huronia, Rideau and Southwestern Regional Centers, run by the Ontario government for more than one hundred years, from the late 1800s until the early 2000s. The settlement acknowledged that many if not all of those who were institutionalized were abused or mistreated in some way, directly and indirectly. The project seeks to offer these authors a highly accessible means of expressing themselves, culminating in the creation of two books, to be published by Wilfrid Laurier University Press, the publication and wide distribution of these books, and the promise that their stories will be carried forward to future audiences through the archived digital media processes used to bring the books to fruition.

In graduate school I specialized in British literature of the period 1740 to 1830; my dissertation was on cross-dressing in eighteenth-century culture and society, with chapters on Christian Davies, Charlotte Charke, and Christopher Smart. After holding a Killam post-doctoral fellowship in the History Department at UBC, I came to Waterloo where I teach and research eighteenth-century and Romantic literature. I am a member of the Advisory Board of the Comparative Literature Department at Fordham University. In August 2004 I was a visiting Associate Professor in the Fachbereich Literaturwissenschaft at the University of Konstanz in Germany and in April 2013 I was a visiting Associate Professor in the School of Foreign Languages at Zhejiang Gongshang University in China. From 2003 to 2007 I chaired the Women's Studies Advisory Board, a university-wide committee. From 2008 to 2015 I served two terms as chair of the English Department.

One of the outputs of this research is a digital humanities database: the Waterloo Cross-Dressing Archive (WXDA). Another is a Twitter feed for the WXDA. The second project seeks to explore the theme and practice of communication in Laurence Sterne, Christopher Smart, William Wordsworth, and Jane Austen through the lens of elocution, the foremost theory of communication in Britain c. 1740 to 1820. In an era of increasing print literacy, elocution focused on and sought to theorize the paralinguistic features of performed speech such as gesture and tone, which among other things were seen as communicative attributes shared between humans and animals.

One of the outputs of this research is a digital humanities database: the Waterloo Cross-Dressing Archive (WXDA). Another is a Twitter feed for the WXDA.\nWaterloo Cross-Dressing Archive\nTwitter feed\nThe second project seeks to explore the theme and practice of communication in Laurence Sterne, Christopher Smart, William Wordsworth, and Jane Austen through the lens of elocution, the foremost theory of communication in Britain c. 1740 to 1820. In an era of increasing print literacy, elocution focused on and sought to theorize the paralinguistic features of performed speech such as gesture and tone, which among other things were seen as communicative attributes shared between humans and animals. This \"body language\" gives a materialized rhetorical shape to matters that can otherwise seem inchoate, abstract, or spiritualized, such as sensibility, identity, embodiment, affect, and sentiment.\nAreas of graduate supervision\nEighteenth-century and Romantic literature The novel Political economy and empire (Adam Smith, Maria Edgeworth) Gender and sexuality studies; literary theory (especially Foucault) Enlightenment rhetoric and media \nEighteenth-century and Romantic literature\nThe novel\nPolitical economy and empire (Adam Smith, Maria Edgeworth)\nGender and sexuality studies; literary theory (especially Foucault)\nEnlightenment rhetoric and media\nAffiliation: University of Waterloo\nAffiliation: \nUniversity of Waterloo\nUniversity of Waterloo\n\n\n"}, {"profile": "https://experts.uwaterloo.ca/clive-forrester", "name": "Clive Forrester", "position": "Lecturer  Faculty of Arts Department of English Language and Literature ", "email": "clive.forrester@uwaterloo.ca", "expertise": ["Advocacy", "Courtroom discourse analysis", "Creole linguistics", "Discourse analysis", "Language and gender", "Language in advertising", "Policy"], "bio": " Continuing LecturerPhD Applied Linguistics, University of the West Indies, Mona BA Linguistics, University of the West Indies, Mona Extension: 45905 Office: HH141 Email: clive.forrester@uwaterloo.ca Website: https://cliveforrester.com Biography I\u2019ve always had an interest in language and literature but actually wanted a career in law, which lead me to apply to the faculty of law at UWI, Mona for my undergraduate degree.

Produced by the Canadian Adaptations of Shakespeare Project and co-directed by Marion Gruner and Sorouja Moll. http://www.canadianshakespeares.ca/multimedia/video/what_means_this_shouting.mov What Means This Shouting? is a short documentary that explores adaptations of Shakespeare's plays by First Nations peoples in Canada. Its focus is Death of a Chief, an adaptation of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. Death of a Chief was co-adapted and co-directed by Yvette Nolan and Kennedy (Cathy) MacKinnon for Native Earth Performing Arts (Toronto), the largest First Nations theatre group in the world. One of Nolan and MacKinnon's adaptations involves re-casting most of the male characters in Julius Caesar as female. \nsmoll@uwaterloo.ca (519) 888-4567 x 41985 Location: ML 238 Sorouja Moll has a PhD in Humanities and Interdisciplinary Studies (Concordia) specializing in the fields of Communication, English, and Art History. She also holds a BA and MA in English from the University of Guelph, School of English and Theatre. As an interdisciplinary scholar, Sorouja's research-creation practice undertakes a multimodal critical discourse analysis of all forms of media including adaptations of Shakespeare in Canada, and an intersectional approach to nineteenth-century archival and narrative-based communication structures and applications, and their present-day manifestations in, among other areas, nation, memory, and identity in performance. Moll\u2019s areas of research include the oral histories of mixed-race identity; Indigenous and non-Indigenous relationship re-building practices and education as meaningful and sustainable; and exploring and creating incubatory spaces in which transgression, enunciation, ambiguity, and emancipation can be explored through performance, theatre, creative writing, and research practices. Her book manuscript, All the Rage: The Trial of Louis Riel & Nineteenth-Century Canadian Media, is a critical discourse analysis of the circulating press during the trial of the M\u00e9tis leader and its present-day implications. Her manuscript is in review.

She has been instrumental in securing the place of performance-informed scholarship in the digital humanities, including through the design of virtual historical reconstructions, pedagogical games, and justice-oriented digital pedagogical environments. JRS is currently a co-director of the qCollaborative (the critical feminist design research lab housed in the University of Waterloo\u2019s Games Institute), and leads the SSHRC-funded Theatre for Relationality and Design for Peace projects. She is also creative director and virtual reality development cluster lead for the Digital Oral Histories for Reconciliation (DOHR) project. Her recent publications have focused on methods for design research that deepen interdisciplinary understanding and take a relational approach to design in community partnerships. In current creative work, JRS is exploring the integration of accessibility and aesthetics, and the relationship between virtual reality and the performative realities that were generated in the medieval and early modern theatre. Jennifer joined the University of Waterloo in 2007, after working as an actor and director in small and large scale Canadian theatres, and teaching at the universities of Ottawa, Toronto, and Windsor. Her work has been supported by SSHRC, MITACS, the Canada Council for the Arts, the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, Oculus, and an Ontario Early Researcher Award.

Biography I grew up in Edmonton and completed my B.A. (English) at the University of Alberta in 1988. After graduation, I spent a brief stint as an Arts Administrator\u2014the highlights of which included arranging a conference call with Margaret Atwood and shielding Alice Walker from a mob of adoring fans during a book-signing. The novelty of close proximity to such luminaries quickly wore off, and I decided to pursue graduate work. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Alberta in 1998. Since 1999, I have been teaching American literature, critical theory, and literary criticism here at Waterloo. My main areas of research and publishing are 19th- and early-20th century popular westerns, particularly by women, women\u2019s science fiction of the 1950s and 60s, and American popular culture. Currently I am working on a biography of popular western author B.M. Bower, and am in the very early stages of a new project on pulp magazines readerships of the early 20th century.

Johns Graduate Fellowship, 1993-1997 Current research I am currently writing a biography of B.M.(Bertha Muzzy) Bower, prolific early 20th century author of popular westerns. Although the popular western has long been believed a male-authored tradition, Bower was the first popularizer of the western as we know it. She wrote over 60 novels and 100s of short stories as well as many film scenarios. Her influence on the western is profound if little known, largely because her publishers discouraged her from doing any publicity. My second research project involves pulp magazine readerships. Early pulp magazines cultivated readerships through reader \u201cdepartments\u201d in which readers debated the merits of the fiction, searched for companionship, or sought advice. They are treasure troves of information about early 20th century popular reading during the emergence of mass-market print culture.

Biography I grew up in Edmonton and completed my B.A. (English) at the University of Alberta in 1988. After graduation, I spent a brief stint as an Arts Administrator\u2014the highlights of which included arranging a conference call with Margaret Atwood and shielding Alice Walker from a mob of adoring fans during a book-signing. The novelty of close proximity to such luminaries quickly wore off, and I decided to pursue graduate work. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Alberta in 1998. Since 1999, I have been teaching American literature, critical theory, and literary criticism here at Waterloo. My main areas of research and publishing are 19th- and early-20th century popular westerns, particularly by women, women\u2019s science fiction of the 1950s and 60s, and American popular culture. Currently I am working on a biography of popular western author B.M. Bower, and am in the very early stages of a new project on pulp magazines readerships of the early 20th century.

My encounter with Professor Nan Johnson in the MA program sparked my interest in rhetoric, and I later earned my PhD in the Department of Rhetoric at the University of California at Berkeley. Prior to coming to Waterloo in 2001, I taught rhetoric and literary theory at the University of Illinois at Chicago for six years. My teaching and research areas include media studies, literature (especially Shakespeare), and the history and theory of rhetoric.

Wheeler and Elliot H. Wheeler Doctoral Fellowship, University of California at Berkeley Current research My current research focuses on two areas of inquiry. First, I am interested in the history and theory of rhetoric, particularly ancient Greek sophistry and its historical legacy. I am presently working on a book that examines the impact of sophistic thought on modern German philosophy (Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, and Heidegger) and contemporary French philosophy (Deleuze, Lacan, Lyotard, and Irigaray). And second, I am interested in modern rhetorical theory, particularly as it relates to mass media, propaganda, and information warfare.

Current research My current research has followed two parallel paths: the intertextual and genetic relation between Homer\u2019s The Odyssey and Joyce\u2019s Ulysses; the genetic history of the making of Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land. I combined these two paths in my latest article \u201cParis, January 1922: Towards the last month of Ulysses and The Waste Land\u201d (currently under review), in which I examined the parallels between the last year of the seven-year composition of Ulysses in 1921 and the composition of The Waste Land from January to December 1921. My primary focus was on January 1922, when Joyce and Eliot, working several blocks away from each other in Paris, brought these two Modernist masterpieces to conclusion through very different though parallel strategies.

I thought the plants and animals were at the top of my list, so I did an undergraduate degree in biology. But I couldn\u2019t ignore the fact that I was better at reading and writing than sampling and dissecting, so I switched over to the humanities at the graduate level. Nothing goes to waste, however, and many of the ideas I developed for my first book, Environmental Renaissance, are drawn from my continuing interest in the life sciences. That book tried to do (too) many things: provide an introduction to social systems theory and cybernetics; reevaluate several canonical 19th century American literary texts; explore the politics of environment; and exhume Thoreau\u2019s brain using concepts from cognitive science and poststructuralism. I also found the time to talk about bottled minnows, huckleberries, Al Pacino, and Saturn (the defunct car company, not the planet). My second book, Entertaining Futility, also had a modest agenda: to critique our dumb present and bleak future, with a few laughs thrown in. What\u2019s my argument? I guess you might say\u2014as I do say in the book\u2014that \u201cWe\u2019re on the cusp of something, certainly a cascading worldwide environmental catastrophe, but maybe, too, a kind of second enlightenment in which we\u2019ll finally see, to our great consternation, that the long march of civilization has always been contained within a longer frogmarch toward oblivion.\u201d Subtopics include climate, Cthulhu, trees, and Twitter. I regularly teach courses on environmental literature, as well as rhetoric, critical discourse analysis, and semiotics. Other areas in which I have less expertise but am willing to opine include horror film and fiction, superheroes, weather, hockey, pumpkins, swords and sorcery, farming (dairy and ant), bricolage, false consciousness, pessimism, catastrophes (esp. world-ending), fish-mongery, listicles, and soup (theory and practice). I like interdisciplinary work because it helps us avoid d\u00e9formation professionnelle or what Kenneth Burke dubbed \u201ctrained incapacity,\u201d a kind of an occupational blindness associated with becoming familiar with one thing very deeply but many other things superficially or not at all. Overspecialization in the humanities, aping the model of science, sometimes divorces the life of the mind from real life.

Her research investigates how rhetorical choices shape the internal processes of science, science bridging internal and public conversations, and public communication of science. For example, she has examined how research journal articles are evolving in response to the replication crisis, theorized intermediate scientific genres such as science crowdfunding proposals, and studied public engagement through utility commission hearings as well as digital engagements through social media platforms. Professor Mehlenbacher is an Associate Professor in English Language and Literature and Canada Research Chair in Science, Health, and Technology Communication at the University of Waterloo. Professor Mehlenbacher is the inaugural Co-Director, with Donna Strickland, for the Trust in Research Undertaken in Science and Technology (TRuST) network. The TRuST network is a transdisciplinary project investigating a range of questions around the concept of trust in science and technology both within scientific and technical research spheres as well as in public communication, sharing, and engagement with science and technology. Professor Mehlenbacher is also a member of the Waterloo Climate Institute, Water Institute, and the Artificial Intelligence Institute. Outside of the University of Waterloo, Professor Mehlenbacher is the Co-Editor, with Carolyn R. Miller, of Genre Across Borders, an international and interdisciplinary network of researchers in genre studies. She has previously served as the President for the Association for the Rhetoric of Science, Technology, and Medicine (ARSTM) and later as a Member of the Board of Directors for the association. Professor Mehlenbacher\u2019s research investigates how genres of scientific and science communications emerge and evolve, how aspects of expertise and ethos interact and relate to trust in scientific and technical domains, and the ethical aspects of specialist/non-specialist relationality in the communication of complex information. Broadly, her research investigates how communication shapes the processes of science and technology and how diverse audiences engage in science and technology through various communication modalities. She is the PI of the CFI-funded Demos Lab, which currently focuses on climate communication. Professor Mehlenbacher has expertise related to effective communication strategies in multidisciplinary collaborations, communication about risk, misinformation, and public communication about science and technology. Professor Mehlenbacher has worked with a range of collaborators. Recently, she worked with Nancy Collins with the University of Waterloo Library to develop a guide to getting started in Science Communication. She also led a team in collaboration with the Royal Canadian Institute for Science (RCIScience) to create an NSERC-supported Science Communication Certificate.

Indeed, we have the scientific and technical tools to enact significant climate action. Currently, Professor Mehlenbacher\u2019s research program examines the critical questions of how we talk about climate change and action in Canada and who we talk to (or, in other words, who we trust to talk to). In this area, she has completed work examining how IPCC reports are described in media coverage and is also examining rhetorical features of the reports as well. Professor Mehlenbacher is also completing the analysis of quantitative and qualitative data collected through a national survey of people in Canada. This work builds on her previous research in rhetorical studies of science, science communication, and environmental communication to investigate how climate change and climate action are discussed and deliberated upon.

Her research investigates how rhetorical choices shape the internal processes of science, science bridging internal and public conversations, and public communication of science. For example, she has examined how research journal articles are evolving in response to the replication crisis, theorized intermediate scientific genres such as science crowdfunding proposals, and studied public engagement through utility commission hearings as well as digital engagements through social media platforms. Professor Mehlenbacher is an Associate Professor in English Language and Literature and Canada Research Chair in Science, Health, and Technology Communication at the University of Waterloo. Professor Mehlenbacher is the inaugural Co-Director, with Donna Strickland, for the Trust in Research Undertaken in Science and Technology (TRuST) network. The TRuST network is a transdisciplinary project investigating a range of questions around the concept of trust in science and technology both within scientific and technical research spheres as well as in public communication, sharing, and engagement with science and technology. Professor Mehlenbacher is also a member of the Waterloo Climate Institute, Water Institute, and the Artificial Intelligence Institute. Outside of the University of Waterloo, Professor Mehlenbacher is the Co-Editor, with Carolyn R. Miller, of Genre Across Borders, an international and interdisciplinary network of researchers in genre studies. She has previously served as the President for the Association for the Rhetoric of Science, Technology, and Medicine (ARSTM) and later as a Member of the Board of Directors for the association. Professor Mehlenbacher\u2019s research investigates how genres of scientific and science communications emerge and evolve, how aspects of expertise and ethos interact and relate to trust in scientific and technical domains, and the ethical aspects of specialist/non-specialist relationality in the communication of complex information. Broadly, her research investigates how communication shapes the processes of science and technology and how diverse audiences engage in science and technology through various communication modalities. She is the PI of the CFI-funded Demos Lab, which currently focuses on climate communication. Professor Mehlenbacher has expertise related to effective communication strategies in multidisciplinary collaborations, communication about risk, misinformation, and public communication about science and technology. Professor Mehlenbacher has worked with a range of collaborators. Recently, she worked with Nancy Collins with the University of Waterloo Library to develop a guide to getting started in Science Communication.

This experience guides the creative hands-on methods espoused by the Critical Media Lab and outlined in detail in his most recent book Making Media Theory: Thinking Critically with Technology.

For example, my current project on \u201cDigital Abstinence\u201d involves designing digital art installations and performances, interviewing Old Order Mennonites, shaping device usage policies at school boards, and conducting research on \u201cmind wandering\u201d with a Cognitive Psychology lab. This means that any given time I am working on several projects with a number of collaborators from diverse disciplines and communities. My future research plans include a more intense focus on \u201cdigital rituals,\u201d which ranges from behaviours learned from persuasive interfaces to algorithmic rituals that determine who or what is in control of an individual\u2019s data. This research stems from my interest in how embodiment intersects with automation. I will also continue to work on the Tech for Good initiative with Communitech and Deloitte, developing workshops, tools, and policies to help tech companies integrate ethics more carefully into their organizations.

I have recently initiated a major international cooperation dedicated to Ancient Black Sea Studies, especially to the Mithradatic dynasty in Pontus and the Cimmerian Bosporus. I pursue long-term research agendas that seek to trace the history of the Galatians from their conquests in Western Asia Minor to their provincialization, and of the Seleucid Empire from its inception to its downfall. My most recent research tries to better understand the history of ancient Judaea in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE by reconstructing the complex process of authoring and editing the main accounts (1 and 2 Maccabees, Josephus\u2019 Jewish Antiquities). All of these regional studies pay particular attention to the mechanisms and effects of Roman imperial diplomacy. Most of my research is embedded in international and interdisciplinary cooperation. Since 2011, I direct the Seleucid Study Group with its Study Days alternating between Canada and Europe. My work on Roman Friendship Diplomacy has yielded several collaborative initiatives; many results are reflected in the database Amici Populi Romani. Together with a network of Black Sea Scholars, I am currently preparing a series of books on the Pontos Euxeinos and the Bosporan Kingdom.

Teaching Roman Political History, Roman Society The Hellenistic World Graeco-Roman Asia Minor The Transformation of the Ancient World in Late Antiquity Latin Literature, esp. Cicero, Livy The History of Democracy, Republicanism and Greek Political Thought My academic patria is the University of Trier in Western Germany, where I studied History and Classics in the 1990s and worked as a research fellow and lecturer in Classics and Ancient History until 2008. I further studied and worked at the Universities of Fribourg, Switzerland (1993), Oxford (2000-2002) and Exeter (2009, 2011). Since 2009, I have been dedicated to the teaching programs of the Classical Studies Department at Waterloo. I am eager to share with my students my general enthusiasm for the ancient world and my excitement for the many discoveries that can still be made. I am particularly committed to the international character of Classical Studies, which encourages the learning of ancient and modern languages alike, the continuous exchange of views beyond the national boundaries, and the mobility of students and profs alike to spend some at Universities abroad. Graduate Supervision I am happy to supervise graduate studies in all the above-mentioned areas. Previously, my students have conducted research on the Galatians, the Seleucids, the Roman Empire and its administration, as well as the Reception of Roman Political Thought. Many projects have led to (peer-reviewed) publications. I am particularly keen on recruiting students for my most recent research project on the Bosporan Kingdom. Administration & Service I am currently the department representative at the Faculty Association. Much of my professional service is to the scholarly community: I am active as a reviewer for national funding agencies (including SSHRC) and renowned publishing houses (including Franz Steiner and Routledge), and I am in the editorial team of the journal Latomus (Brussels).

I pursue long-term research agendas that seek to trace the history of the Galatians from their conquests in Western Asia Minor to their provincialization, and of the Seleucid Empire from its inception to its downfall. My most recent research tries to better understand the history of ancient Judaea in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE by reconstructing the complex process of authoring and editing the main accounts (1 and 2 Maccabees, Josephus\u2019 Jewish Antiquities). All of these regional studies pay particular attention to the mechanisms and effects of Roman imperial diplomacy. Most of my research is embedded in international and interdisciplinary cooperation. Since 2011, I direct the Seleucid Study Group with its Study Days alternating between Canada and Europe. My work on Roman Friendship Diplomacy has yielded several collaborative initiatives; many results are reflected in the database Amici Populi Romani. Together with a network of Black Sea Scholars, I am currently preparing a series of books on the Pontos Euxeinos and the Bosporan Kingdom. A previous cooperation with the University of Trier has yielded the first handbook on the history of foreigners\u2019 rights and citizenship from the ancient Near East to the present day (Fremd und Rechtlos?).

Teaching Roman Political History, Roman Society The Hellenistic World Graeco-Roman Asia Minor The Transformation of the Ancient World in Late Antiquity Latin Literature, esp. Cicero, Livy The History of Democracy, Republicanism and Greek Political Thought My academic patria is the University of Trier in Western Germany, where I studied History and Classics in the 1990s and worked as a research fellow and lecturer in Classics and Ancient History until 2008. I further studied and worked at the Universities of Fribourg, Switzerland (1993), Oxford (2000-2002) and Exeter (2009, 2011). Since 2009, I have been dedicated to the teaching programs of the Classical Studies Department at Waterloo. I am eager to share with my students my general enthusiasm for the ancient world and my excitement for the many discoveries that can still be made. I am particularly committed to the international character of Classical Studies, which encourages the learning of ancient and modern languages alike, the continuous exchange of views beyond the national boundaries, and the mobility of students and profs alike to spend some at Universities abroad. Graduate Supervision I am happy to supervise graduate studies in all the above-mentioned areas. Previously, my students have conducted research on the Galatians, the Seleucids, the Roman Empire and its administration, as well as the Reception of Roman Political Thought. Many projects have led to (peer-reviewed) publications. I am particularly keen on recruiting students for my most recent research project on the Bosporan Kingdom. Administration & Service I am currently the department representative at the Faculty Association. Much of my professional service is to the scholarly community: I am active as a reviewer for national funding agencies (including SSHRC) and renowned publishing houses (including Franz Steiner and Routledge), and I am in the editorial team of the journal Latomus (Brussels).

The intertextuality of Hellenistic Greek and Latin Augustan poetry is the focus of much of my work in classical antiquity, and I read the writings of Homer, Theocritus and Apollonius, as well as Horace, Vergil and other Latin poets. Recent publications in this field include a co-edited volume of essays entitled Comparing Roman Hellenisms in Italy and an edited collection of studies, Celebrity, Fame and Infamy in the Hellenistic World. Two representative articles focus on intermediality in epic ekphrasis and on the description of a shield in Antimachus' Thebaid. In the area of neo-Latin literature I am particularly interested in the New Testament scholarship of Erasmus. I\u2019ve produced an edition of Erasmus\u2019 Annotations on Galatians and Ephesians, and a translation of the Synopsis Purioris Theologiae. Current projects focus on Greek and Latin poetry (especially pastoral and epic) and early modern Latin prose. I would be pleased to supervise graduate students in any of these areas. Teaching Greek and Latin Epic Poetry Hellenistic Literature Greek and Latin Language Ancient Greek Society I teach a range of courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, from first-year Latin and Classical Civilization courses to senior seminars in Greek and Latin language and literature. My undergraduate teaching currently includes courses in the Greek language; Classical myth, literature and art; and Latin poetry. Graduate Teaching and Supervision In recent years I have co-taught the required MA-level course, Research Methodologies in Classical Studies. Other courses have treated representations of the other in Roman literature; Hellenistic poetry; and analyses of Cicero\u2019s rhetorical style. I have supervised students researching a wide range of topics, including the epigrams of Leonidas, closure in Vergil\u2019s Eclogues, gendered voices in Ovid's Heroides, and the descriptive mode in Flavian poetry. I regularly involve graduate students as Research Assistants or Tutorial Assistants. Enquiries from potential students are most welcome. Administration & Service I have served the department as undergraduate or graduate advisor several terms, and twice as chair. From 2010-2013 and 2013-2016 I was the director of the Waterloo Institute for Hellenistic Studies. Currently I serve as chair of the editorial board for the Collected Works of Erasmus.

Discovering in the process that my talents lay in languages and philosophy instead of physics and mathematics, I gave up on the idea of planetary astronomy and instead came to the University of Waterloo for an Honours BA in Medieval Studies. I did my MA at the Centre for Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto before moving on to the Warburg Institute (University of London) for a PhD under the supervision of Prof. Charles Burnett, completed in 2001. After holding a SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Religion & Culture Department at Wilfrid Laurier University, I came to be the medievalist in the Classical Studies Department at the University of Waterloo. I am currently Co-Director of the Undergraduate program in Medieval Studies. Broadly speaking, my research interests involve Medieval intellectual history, especially the reception of the pagan Classical tradition in the Christian Middle Ages. The main focus of my research has been the enigmatic figure of Hermes Trismegistus. In the process of hunting for any and all references to Hermes during the Middle Ages, I have conducted research at over thirty manuscript libraries scattered throughout Europe. Along the way, I have become interested in ancient and Medieval magic, astrology, alchemy, palaeography, manuscript transmission and glosses. This path has led me, along with my co-author and collaborator Dan Attrell, to produce a new English translation of the Latin astral magic text known as Picatrix, which appeared in 2019 through the Pennsylvania State University Press. More recently, Dan, myself, and a third collaborator (and UW alumnus) Brett Bartlett have completed and submitted for publication an annotated English translation of Marsilio Ficino's polemical work De Christiana religione. In parallel to my interest in intellectual history, I have begun examining the dynamics of the rise, flourishing and downfall of complex societies, especially with regard to the impact of resource depletion on these processes.My teaching interests include Latin (Classical & Medieval), magic & esoterica, ancient religious traditions in general and the Hermetic tradition in particular, Medieval Studies broadly construed (Medieval society, defining the Middle Ages) and the decline and fall of ancient Roman civilization.

For more detailed information see my Curriculum Vitae \nAcademic Biography\nI was born in Montr\u00e9al and attended the Coll\u00e8ge Jean-de-Br\u00e9beuf through the end of C\u00c9GEP in pure & applied sciences. Discovering in the process that my talents lay in languages and philosophy instead of physics and mathematics, I gave up on the idea of planetary astronomy and instead came to the University of Waterloo for an Honours BA in Medieval Studies. I did my MA at the Centre for Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto before moving on to the Warburg Institute (University of London) for a PhD under the supervision of Prof. Charles Burnett, completed in 2001. After holding a SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Religion & Culture Department at Wilfrid Laurier University, I came to be the medievalist in the Classical Studies Department at the University of Waterloo. I am currently Co-Director of the Undergraduate program in Medieval Studies.\nBroadly speaking, my research interests involve Medieval intellectual history, especially the reception of the pagan Classical tradition in the Christian Middle Ages. The main focus of my research has been the enigmatic figure of Hermes Trismegistus. In the process of hunting for any and all references to Hermes during the Middle Ages, I have conducted research at over thirty manuscript libraries scattered throughout Europe. Along the way, I have become interested in ancient and Medieval magic, astrology, alchemy, palaeography, manuscript transmission and glosses. This path has led me, along with my co-author and collaborator Dan Attrell, to produce a new English translation of the Latin astral magic text known as Picatrix, which appeared in 2019 through the Pennsylvania State University Press. More recently, Dan, myself, and a third collaborator (and UW alumnus) Brett Bartlett have completed and submitted for publication an annotated English translation of Marsilio Ficino's polemical work De Christiana religione.\nPicatrix\nDe Christiana religione\nIn parallel to my interest in intellectual history, I have begun examining the dynamics of the rise, flourishing and downfall of complex societies, especially with regard to the impact of resource depletion on these processes.My teaching interests include Latin (Classical & Medieval), magic & esoterica, ancient religious traditions in general and the Hermetic tradition in particular, Medieval Studies broadly construed (Medieval society, defining the Middle Ages) and the decline and fall of ancient Roman civilization.\nMy teaching interests include Latin (Classical & Medieval), magic & esoterica, ancient religious traditions in general and the Hermetic tradition in particular, Medieval Studies broadly construed (Medieval society, defining the Middle Ages) and the decline and fall of ancient Roman civilization.\nRecent Publications:\nRecent Publications:\nMarsilio Ficino (1433-1499).

She has held residential fellowships at the Collegium de Lyon (2017-2018) and the Nantes Institute for Advanced Study (2020-2021) and is a Connaught (2007-2009) and Vanier scholar (2009-2012). She is also a research fellow in the Migration, Mobilities, and Social Politics Cluster at the Balsillie School of International Affairs. A political anthropologist, Se\u00e7il Da\u01e7ta\u0219 specializes in the gender politics and secular governance of religious diversity, minority and refugee displacement, religious nationalisms, and the political potential of everyday sociality at the crossroads of Europe and the Middle East. Her current work examines the intersections of religion and gender in shaping border politics in Turkey and Cyprus, and probes the political possibilities and limits of solidarity as the condition of urban cohabitation between a diverse group of displaced Syrians and local citizens. She is particularly interested in how gendered social spaces at the Middle Eastern borderlands call into question humanitarian and state-centered approaches to refugee resettlement, and expand our understandings of what constitutes politics beyond formal political institutions and mechanisms. At UW, Se\u00e7il Da\u01e7ta\u0219 teaches courses on the anthropology of gender, anthropology of religion, Muslim lives and practices, and the relationship between state borders and sociocultural boundaries. She supervises graduate work in the areas of nationalism, secularism, border politics, everyday Islam, and the cultural politics of displacement. Research Projects and Awards 2021-2025.

She is also a research fellow in the Migration, Mobilities, and Social Politics Cluster at the Balsillie School of International Affairs. A political anthropologist, Se\u00e7il Da\u01e7ta\u0219 specializes in the gender politics and secular governance of religious diversity, minority and refugee displacement, religious nationalisms, and the political potential of everyday sociality at the crossroads of Europe and the Middle East. Her current work examines the intersections of religion and gender in shaping border politics in Turkey and Cyprus, and probes the political possibilities and limits of solidarity as the condition of urban cohabitation between a diverse group of displaced Syrians and local citizens. She is particularly interested in how gendered social spaces at the Middle Eastern borderlands call into question humanitarian and state-centered approaches to refugee resettlement, and expand our understandings of what constitutes politics beyond formal political institutions and mechanisms. At UW, Se\u00e7il Da\u01e7ta\u0219 teaches courses on the anthropology of gender, anthropology of religion, Muslim lives and practices, and the relationship between state borders and sociocultural boundaries.

She is also a research fellow in the Migration, Mobilities, and Social Politics Cluster at the Balsillie School of International Affairs. A political anthropologist, Se\u00e7il Da\u01e7ta\u0219 specializes in the gender politics and secular governance of religious diversity, minority and refugee displacement, religious nationalisms, and the political potential of everyday sociality at the crossroads of Europe and the Middle East. Her current work examines the intersections of religion and gender in shaping border politics in Turkey and Cyprus, and probes the political possibilities and limits of solidarity as the condition of urban cohabitation between a diverse group of displaced Syrians and local citizens. She is particularly interested in how gendered social spaces at the Middle Eastern borderlands call into question humanitarian and state-centered approaches to refugee resettlement, and expand our understandings of what constitutes politics beyond formal political institutions and mechanisms.

She is particularly interested in how gendered social spaces at the Middle Eastern borderlands call into question humanitarian and state-centered approaches to refugee resettlement, and expand our understandings of what constitutes politics beyond formal political institutions and mechanisms. At UW, Se\u00e7il Da\u01e7ta\u0219 teaches courses on the anthropology of gender, anthropology of religion, Muslim lives and practices, and the relationship between state borders and sociocultural boundaries. She supervises graduate work in the areas of nationalism, secularism, border politics, everyday Islam, and the cultural politics of displacement. Research Projects and Awards 2021-2025.

Her dissertation explored the ability of teeth to serve as biomarkers of nutritional stress in Mexican communities living with mild-to-moderate malnutrition. She then completed a SSHRC-funded postdoctoral research fellowship at the University of Western Ontario, prior to becoming a full-time teaching faculty member there for several years. Alexis joined the Anthropology Department at the University of Waterloo in 2016. Research As a biological anthropologist, Dr. Dolphin specializes in dental anthropology, human osteology, bioarchaeology, paleonutrition and paleopollution, with an emphasis on reconstructing the experiences of mothers and children via chemical and histological analyses of teeth and bones. While her previous fieldwork was conducted in Ontario, Belize, Mexico, Iceland, and Peru, she currently co-directs excavations of the Wadi Faynan 100 cemetery located in Jordan (with Dr. Russell Adams). Her laboratory work utilizes human bones and teeth from ancient and contemporary samples from around the world, and here in Canada. She is the Director of the Ancient and Contemporary Environmental Bioindicators Laboratory (ACEBioLab) located in the Department of Anthropology. Dr. Dolphin recently completed a project examining the health of children living in early medieval Bergen, Norway, during a period of rapid urbanization, and enjoyed several Guest Researcher appointments at the University of Bergen which were sponsored by the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study Tooth Bank (MoBaTann). Her more recent work has used trace elements, stable isotopes and dental histology to study paleopollution, mobility, and childhood stress, respectively. From a methodological perspective, Dr. Dolphin focuses on histological and microspatial chemical analyses (LA-ICP-MS, synchrotron XRF) of teeth and bones. She works to situate laboratory results within larger public and academic discussions regarding embodiment, lived experience, power, inequality and diversity. As an anthropologist dedicated to taking a critical biocultural approach to understanding humans, Dr. Dolphin also conducts research related to the body and its shifting location in debates regarding ownership of biomaterials, sex/gender and sexuality, and the evolution of so-called human behavioural universals. Laboratory The Ancient and Contemporary Environmental Bioindicators Laboratory (ACEBioLab), located in PAS 2271, supports research on human-environment interactions utilizing cutting edge technology for conducting microspatial analyses of human tissues from past and living populations. This laboratory houses sample preparation systems (including precision saws, grinder/polishers, micromill) and microscopes with 2D and 3D imaging systems. Support for the foundation of ACEBioLab comes from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation \u2013 John R. Evans Leaders Fund and an Ontario Research Fund \u2013 Infrastructure grant (#37473).

Her dissertation explored the ability of teeth to serve as biomarkers of nutritional stress in Mexican communities living with mild-to-moderate malnutrition. She then completed a SSHRC-funded postdoctoral research fellowship at the University of Western Ontario, prior to becoming a full-time teaching faculty member there for several years. Alexis joined the Anthropology Department at the University of Waterloo in 2016. Research As a biological anthropologist, Dr. Dolphin specializes in dental anthropology, human osteology, bioarchaeology, paleonutrition and paleopollution, with an emphasis on reconstructing the experiences of mothers and children via chemical and histological analyses of teeth and bones. While her previous fieldwork was conducted in Ontario, Belize, Mexico, Iceland, and Peru, she currently co-directs excavations of the Wadi Faynan 100 cemetery located in Jordan (with Dr. Russell Adams). Her laboratory work utilizes human bones and teeth from ancient and contemporary samples from around the world, and here in Canada. She is the Director of the Ancient and Contemporary Environmental Bioindicators Laboratory (ACEBioLab) located in the Department of Anthropology. Dr. Dolphin recently completed a project examining the health of children living in early medieval Bergen, Norway, during a period of rapid urbanization, and enjoyed several Guest Researcher appointments at the University of Bergen which were sponsored by the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study Tooth Bank (MoBaTann). Her more recent work has used trace elements, stable isotopes and dental histology to study paleopollution, mobility, and childhood stress, respectively. From a methodological perspective, Dr. Dolphin focuses on histological and microspatial chemical analyses (LA-ICP-MS, synchrotron XRF) of teeth and bones. She works to situate laboratory results within larger public and academic discussions regarding embodiment, lived experience, power, inequality and diversity. As an anthropologist dedicated to taking a critical biocultural approach to understanding humans, Dr. Dolphin also conducts research related to the body and its shifting location in debates regarding ownership of biomaterials, sex/gender and sexuality, and the evolution of so-called human behavioural universals. Laboratory The Ancient and Contemporary Environmental Bioindicators Laboratory (ACEBioLab), located in PAS 2271, supports research on human-environment interactions utilizing cutting edge technology for conducting microspatial analyses of human tissues from past and living populations. This laboratory houses sample preparation systems (including precision saws, grinder/polishers, micromill) and microscopes with 2D and 3D imaging systems. Support for the foundation of ACEBioLab comes from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation \u2013 John R. Evans Leaders Fund and an Ontario Research Fund \u2013 Infrastructure grant (#37473).

Instruction and Practical Reasoning in Science Education and Scientific Research This research focuses on documenting and analyzing the instruction, learning and practical reasoning of junior scientists using ethnography, including video recordings. This includes studying how they use media, diagrams and documents, and how counting, measuring and data analyses unfold as socio-technical practices. Following an extended study of data-centric astronomy I have begun the project \u201cMaking sense of data re-use in environmental science.\u201d Funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, this project considers how junior climate scientists are instructed to produce, use, and re-use digital data using diverse technologies and material probes, and how scientists work and communicate in multi-disciplinary contexts typical of Earth systems science. This includes how scientists working in the field and the lab communicate and collaborate with experts in computer simulation, data analysis and modelling. Grassroots Measures This comparative study examines how members of local communities, in Canada and elsewhere, generate and use self-made measure(ment)s to specify pollution in the environment, environmental change, poverty, and social inequities, often to contest scientific measurements and those generated by state institutions. This work builds on, and supplements, my ethnographic fieldwork with fishers and social activists in Kerala, south India. Doing Citizen Science with Digital Media I am interested in supervising students who want to explore citizen science and digital media (including smartphone apps), especially (but not only) in relation to the environment, and there especially to the monitoring of biodiversity and pollution (air, water, soil) in southern Ontario and elsewhere. Opportunities for Graduate Student Projects I welcome applications from prospective graduate students who are broadly interested in my research and teaching areas listed above. I seek to fill two MA student fellowships as part of the SSHRC-funded research project \u201cMaking sense of data re-use in environmental science.\u201d These students shall be guided to conduct detailed ethnographic case studies of exemplary work in a climate science laboratory, focusing on how junior climate scientists learn to produce, use, and re-use digital data. Available funding for these students includes travel and accommodation expenses for conducting ethnographic fieldwork in Germany as well as conference travel.

Instruction and Practical Reasoning in Science Education and Scientific Research This research focuses on documenting and analyzing the instruction, learning and practical reasoning of junior scientists using ethnography, including video recordings. This includes studying how they use media, diagrams and documents, and how counting, measuring and data analyses unfold as socio-technical practices. Following an extended study of data-centric astronomy I have begun the project \u201cMaking sense of data re-use in environmental science.\u201d Funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, this project considers how junior climate scientists are instructed to produce, use, and re-use digital data using diverse technologies and material probes, and how scientists work and communicate in multi-disciplinary contexts typical of Earth systems science. This includes how scientists working in the field and the lab communicate and collaborate with experts in computer simulation, data analysis and modelling. Grassroots Measures This comparative study examines how members of local communities, in Canada and elsewhere, generate and use self-made measure(ment)s to specify pollution in the environment, environmental change, poverty, and social inequities, often to contest scientific measurements and those generated by state institutions. This work builds on, and supplements, my ethnographic fieldwork with fishers and social activists in Kerala, south India. Doing Citizen Science with Digital Media I am interested in supervising students who want to explore citizen science and digital media (including smartphone apps), especially (but not only) in relation to the environment, and there especially to the monitoring of biodiversity and pollution (air, water, soil) in southern Ontario and elsewhere. Opportunities for Graduate Student Projects I welcome applications from prospective graduate students who are broadly interested in my research and teaching areas listed above. I seek to fill two MA student fellowships as part of the SSHRC-funded research project \u201cMaking sense of data re-use in environmental science.\u201d These students shall be guided to conduct detailed ethnographic case studies of exemplary work in a climate science laboratory, focusing on how junior climate scientists learn to produce, use, and re-use digital data. Available funding for these students includes travel and accommodation expenses for conducting ethnographic fieldwork in Germany as well as conference travel.

Instruction and Practical Reasoning in Science Education and Scientific Research This research focuses on documenting and analyzing the instruction, learning and practical reasoning of junior scientists using ethnography, including video recordings. This includes studying how they use media, diagrams and documents, and how counting, measuring and data analyses unfold as socio-technical practices. Following an extended study of data-centric astronomy I have begun the project \u201cMaking sense of data re-use in environmental science.\u201d Funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, this project considers how junior climate scientists are instructed to produce, use, and re-use digital data using diverse technologies and material probes, and how scientists work and communicate in multi-disciplinary contexts typical of Earth systems science. This includes how scientists working in the field and the lab communicate and collaborate with experts in computer simulation, data analysis and modelling. Grassroots Measures This comparative study examines how members of local communities, in Canada and elsewhere, generate and use self-made measure(ment)s to specify pollution in the environment, environmental change, poverty, and social inequities, often to contest scientific measurements and those generated by state institutions. This work builds on, and supplements, my ethnographic fieldwork with fishers and social activists in Kerala, south India. Doing Citizen Science with Digital Media I am interested in supervising students who want to explore citizen science and digital media (including smartphone apps), especially (but not only) in relation to the environment, and there especially to the monitoring of biodiversity and pollution (air, water, soil) in southern Ontario and elsewhere. Opportunities for Graduate Student Projects I welcome applications from prospective graduate students who are broadly interested in my research and teaching areas listed above. I seek to fill two MA student fellowships as part of the SSHRC-funded research project \u201cMaking sense of data re-use in environmental science.\u201d These students shall be guided to conduct detailed ethnographic case studies of exemplary work in a climate science laboratory, focusing on how junior climate scientists learn to produce, use, and re-use digital data.

I am a multi-disciplinary artist, scholar, and teacher, I integrate these multiple areas into my published work and instruction, such as communication, composition and rhetoric, education, American literature, and theatre. I am perhaps best known for advancing my educational and sociolinguistic concept \u201ccode-meshing,\u201d which means allowing minoritized language users to blend their cultural and heritage languages within academic, professional and public writing and speaking. As a professor, I have also served on faculty at University of Iowa and University of Kentucky. But I have done and do other stuff too: I have served as a high school drama/English/speech teacher, an elementary school principal, a supervisor of itinerant theater teachers in Los Angeles, and a school board administrator. I have a JD law degree and have served as a child protection mediator for the Ontario Ministry and a family mediator in Canada and the USA. I often work as a diversity consultant to schools and organizations, conducting training on cultural competency, interpersonal and intercultural communication. I often conduct workshops with my colleague in the UW English Department, Frankie Condon. I am also a solo performance artist and actor. I had the honor to be recognized for \u201cbest performance in a play,\u201d for my portrayal of the brain-damaged Gabriel in August Wilson\u2019s Fences. I also regularly tour my one-man show, Your Average Nigga, based on my first book of the same name. I am currently performing the lead male role\u2014Robert Chiltern\u2014in Oscar Wilde\u2019s An Ideal Husband. Between 2020 and present, I have been awarded two (2) external and one (1) internal research support grants, published one (1) critical textbook that combines the study of language and culture with a study of interracial understanding after George Floyd, published three (3) single authored and one (1) co-authored research articles, four (4) research mobilization articles (short articles in the public press, such as scholarly op-eds, perspectives, and points of view), delivered twenty-one (21 or more) keynote addresses, facilitated twenty (20 or more) international and nationwide faculty development workshops on antiracist communication and code meshing, served as one (1) named visiting professor at a major research intensive university.

I am also completing a book on the performance of black masculinity in the media by successful African American men: Barack Obama, playwright August Wilson, and comedian Dave Chappelle. I am analyzing how American racial discourse produces masculine anxiety for Black men as they participate in traditional white male dominated spaces. Areas of Graduate Supervision Autoethnography Black Studies (esp. African Americans and U.S. Law after Jim Crow; Black drama and theatre, Black performance of everyday life, Black masculinity) Composition and Rhetoric (Translingual Writing, Code Meshing, Code Switching, Relationship between speech/oral communication and writing/composition) African American literature (Dramatic Literature of the Harlem Renaissance, Late 20th/21st Century Authors, James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Daniel Black, W.E.B DuBois) \nJD, Mitchell Hamline College of Law PhD, University of Illinois at Chicago Extension: 31596Email: vershawn.young@uwaterloo.ca Website: http://dr-vay2014.wix.com/vershawn-young Biography My academic work falls primarily in three areas of Black Studies (masculinity studies, language studies and performance studies). I am a multi-disciplinary artist, scholar, and teacher, I integrate these multiple areas into my published work and instruction, such as communication, composition and rhetoric, education, American literature, and theatre. I am perhaps best known for advancing my educational and sociolinguistic concept \u201ccode-meshing,\u201d which means allowing minoritized language users to blend their cultural and heritage languages within academic, professional and public writing and speaking. As a professor, I have also served on faculty at University of Iowa and University of Kentucky. But I have done and do other stuff too: I have served as a high school drama/English/speech teacher, an elementary school principal, a supervisor of itinerant theater teachers in Los Angeles, and a school board administrator. I have a JD law degree and have served as a child protection mediator for the Ontario Ministry and a family mediator in Canada and the USA. I often work as a diversity consultant to schools and organizations, conducting training on cultural competency, interpersonal and intercultural communication. I often conduct workshops with my colleague in the UW English Department, Frankie Condon. I am also a solo performance artist and actor. I had the honor to be recognized for \u201cbest performance in a play,\u201d for my portrayal of the brain-damaged Gabriel in August Wilson\u2019s Fences. I also regularly tour my one-man show, Your Average Nigga, based on my first book of the same name. I am currently performing the lead male role\u2014Robert Chiltern\u2014in Oscar Wilde\u2019s An Ideal Husband. Between 2020 and present, I have been awarded two (2) external and one (1) internal research support grants, published one (1) critical textbook that combines the study of language and culture with a study of interracial understanding after George Floyd, published three (3) single authored and one (1) co-authored research articles, four (4) research mobilization articles (short articles in the public press, such as scholarly op-eds, perspectives, and points of view), delivered twenty-one (21 or more) keynote addresses, facilitated twenty (20 or more) international and nationwide faculty development workshops on antiracist communication and code meshing, served as one (1) named visiting professor at a major research intensive university.

Biography The University of Waterloo offered me my first position as an Assistant Professor in July 2010. It represents the starting point of a new career and the end of a long journey toward my PhD that started in 1990 when I entered the undergraduate program of economics at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. I knew I wanted to become an economist from the beginning, but it is only at the third year, while taking graduate courses in econometrics, that I decided to become a professor. I was not only interested to learn new techniques, I was also beginning to enjoy teaching my classmates when they were asking for help. My first choice was to go to the United States, but I decided to go to Queen's University in 1993 to do a master's, to be more prepared and to improve my English. At Queen's, I wrote an essay in which I was estimating the core inflation using the Kalman filter with conditionally heteroscedastic errors. The following year I entered the PhD program at Yale University and completed all the requirements except my thesis. In 1999, I decided to put an end to my PhD and came back to Canada, where I could better take care of my new daughter. While at Yale, I received the Raymond Powell Teaching Prize for the microeconomics course I gave to master's students in development economics. It made me consider becoming a full time lecturer. I slowly started with one course to Masters of Business Administration's (MBA) at \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes commerciales de Montr\u00e9al (H\u00c9C Montreal) and ended up teaching between 15 and 20 courses per year at H\u00c9C Montreal, the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and L'Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (UQ\u00c0M) between 2000 to 2004. During that period, I taught courses such as microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, mathematical economics and financial economics for both graduate and undergraduate students. I even had the chance to go to Guinea to teach microeconomics to Guinean professors as part of an education reform program financed by the World Bank. I was enjoying teaching, but something was missing. Many graduate students were coming to me to get help with their research because my door was always open. I then realized that I was missing research. Therefore, in 2004 I decided to register at UQ\u00c0M as a PhD student to finish my degree. Because I did not want my family to suffer from this decision, I completed my PhD while being a full time lecturer, teaching an average of 12 courses per year. While doing my PhD and teaching, I developed an R package for the generalized method of moments. I am glad now to be part of the econometric community and hope I can make significant contributions.

It represents the starting point of a new career and the end of a long journey toward my PhD that started in 1990 when I entered the undergraduate program of economics at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. I knew I wanted to become an economist from the beginning, but it is only at the third year, while taking graduate courses in econometrics, that I decided to become a professor. I was not only interested to learn new techniques, I was also beginning to enjoy teaching my classmates when they were asking for help. My first choice was to go to the United States, but I decided to go to Queen's University in 1993 to do a master's, to be more prepared and to improve my English. At Queen's, I wrote an essay in which I was estimating the core inflation using the Kalman filter with conditionally heteroscedastic errors. The following year I entered the PhD program at Yale University and completed all the requirements except my thesis. In 1999, I decided to put an end to my PhD and came back to Canada, where I could better take care of my new daughter. While at Yale, I received the Raymond Powell Teaching Prize for the microeconomics course I gave to master's students in development economics. It made me consider becoming a full time lecturer. I slowly started with one course to Masters of Business Administration's (MBA) at \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes commerciales de Montr\u00e9al (H\u00c9C Montreal) and ended up teaching between 15 and 20 courses per year at H\u00c9C Montreal, the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and L'Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (UQ\u00c0M) between 2000 to 2004. During that period, I taught courses such as microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, mathematical economics and financial economics for both graduate and undergraduate students. I even had the chance to go to Guinea to teach microeconomics to Guinean professors as part of an education reform program financed by the World Bank. I was enjoying teaching, but something was missing. Many graduate students were coming to me to get help with their research because my door was always open. I then realized that I was missing research. Therefore, in 2004 I decided to register at UQ\u00c0M as a PhD student to finish my degree. Because I did not want my family to suffer from this decision, I completed my PhD while being a full time lecturer, teaching an average of 12 courses per year. While doing my PhD and teaching, I developed an R package for the generalized method of moments. I am glad now to be part of the econometric community and hope I can make significant contributions.

I teach mathematical economics and econometrics both at undergraduate and graduate level.\nBiography\nTao spent his first 22 years in Shanghai, China. Before he became an Assistant Professor at the University of Waterloo, he was in graduate school for 9 years in New England, USA.\nHis research on econometrics is both theoretical and applied. The theoretical part focuses mainly on micro-econometrics and functional data analysis; and the major applied fields are labor and urban economics.\nTao is a big fan of basketball, Age of Empires and enjoys reading \u201cA Global History: From Prehistory to the 21st Century\u201d.

I developed a deep appreciation for economics when I started to study game theory seriously and realised how broad (and subtle) are the tools that economists use. I understood that my disparate interests could all, to some degree, be accommodated within economics and decided to go on to do a PhD as an applied game theorist.

While enrolled in Commerce and Finance at the University of Toronto, I discovered that I appreciated economics\u2026though even at that age, the assumption that consumers and firms have \u2018full information\u2019 struck me as implausible. Still, I could see that the application of economic principles was crucial to understanding economic issues. My PhD advisor, JJ Spengler, a Past President of the American Economics Association, was well-recognized as a man-of-all-science. This breadth gave me a keen appreciation of the enriched understanding that can be made by other disciplines. At doctorate time, I found I was demographically lucky (scarce) with an overwhelming number of job offers. I chose the University of Waterloo because it was so confidently different from other universities. Students who choose Waterloo are also different \u2013 in a most positive way. Over the years I have thoroughly enjoyed the two-way learning exchange with students bringing work term experience to class. Second year micro \u2013 with practical examples \u2013 was one gratifying class. I created a fun class now called consumer economics and marketing and another applied course in Canadian economic problems. Later success of students really is impressive and, of course, I always claim more credit than the evidence justifies. For more than three decades exhilarating exercise included playing competitive basketball with the Pheasants, a faculty/staff team with a respectable record in the University intramural league. I enjoy working with students, faculty, staff, off-campus teachers, activists, policy-makers and others. This interest includes the Board of the Canadian Foundation for Economic Education: an NGO providing highly effective original material for students at all ages. I\u2019ve had impressive and unselfish support from University members including staff in several roles, including terms as Chair of Economics, and as Dean of the Faculty of Arts at a time when new graduate programs were initiated in a dozen different departments. As an Adjunct Professor, I am working with consumer-interest researchers in nine different disciplines, with consumer protection agencies and with consumer NGOs and graduate students to produce a Canadian network to help the country use research for evidence-based policies to make a significant improvement in our standard of living. Research interests My research has a focus on consumer economics. Why don\u2019t consumers gain the benefits a competitive economy is supposed to deliver? Can we remove regulations that give favours to special interests yet keep regulations that protect health and safety? Why are there so many scams? Why does shoddy service persist in the market? I learned much from experience in other countries: in the EU and in research institutes and rewarding work with consumer organizations in more than 20 developing countries. My wife Bari and our two sons Rob and Derek never complained: they seemed to thrive in every far-flung location. Particularly rewarding was a span of volunteer advocacy work in Canada- working with others \u2013 to help Canada bring in its Competition Act \u2013 a process that absorbed 13 years. This led to further public interest presentations on consumer issues. In all, I testified more than three dozen occasions as an \u2018expert\u2019 witness at parliamentary hearings and Senate or other enquiries relating to proposed legislation. When private interest lobbyists were strong, little or nothing was gained from my work for the public interest. It is too late to start, though if the stars suddenly line up. Progress was made on many issues: trade policy, metrication, truth-in-pricing, consumption taxes, financial sector transparency and redress. In 1990 I wrote \"Financial Quality and the Consumer Interest\", in the Canadian Banker / Le Banquier and in 1995, \"A Consumer Test for Financial Regulation in Canada,\u201d published in Policy Options / Options Politiques. Right after that I was lucky to be asked to supervise a program of consumer-interest research for the MacKay Task Force on the Future of Canada\u2019s Financial Services Sector. The research on consumer policies in eight countries was published in 1998 in two volumes. That research helped then Finance Minister Paul Martin create Canada\u2019s Financial Consumers Agency (FCAC) in 2001. The FCAC was designed to bring the effectiveness of Canada\u2019s financial services up to the best international level. The evidence shows that consumer-oriented improvements took place right away at Canadian banks and financial institutions. The Office played a role in avoiding the market misconduct problems experienced in the U.S. misconduct (selling \u201cmortgage-backed\u201d securities, for example) that helped provoke the worldwide financial meltdown in 2008. Ireland and other countries followed Canada\u2019s example and a decade later the US created its own Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with much stronger provisions. For the fun and a treasured measure of success I owe sincere thanks to an understanding family, a huge number of collaborators, team mates, colleagues, grad and undergraduate students, friends, administrators and staff supporters. I have been blessed by people who astonish me with how much help far beyond their job descriptions they willingly perform. Selected publications 2018. Robert R.

I chose the University of Waterloo because it was so confidently different from other universities. Students who choose Waterloo are also different \u2013 in a most positive way. Over the years I have thoroughly enjoyed the two-way learning exchange with students bringing work term experience to class.

I created a fun class now called consumer economics and marketing and another applied course in Canadian economic problems.

As an Adjunct Professor, I am working with consumer-interest researchers in nine different disciplines, with consumer protection agencies and with consumer NGOs and graduate students to produce a Canadian network to help the country use research for evidence-based policies to make a significant improvement in our standard of living. Research interests My research has a focus on consumer economics. Why don\u2019t consumers gain the benefits a competitive economy is supposed to deliver? Can we remove regulations that give favours to special interests yet keep regulations that protect health and safety? Why are there so many scams? Why does shoddy service persist in the market? I learned much from experience in other countries: in the EU and in research institutes and rewarding work with consumer organizations in more than 20 developing countries. My wife Bari and our two sons Rob and Derek never complained: they seemed to thrive in every far-flung location. Particularly rewarding was a span of volunteer advocacy work in Canada- working with others \u2013 to help Canada bring in its Competition Act \u2013 a process that absorbed 13 years. This led to further public interest presentations on consumer issues. In all, I testified more than three dozen occasions as an \u2018expert\u2019 witness at parliamentary hearings and Senate or other enquiries relating to proposed legislation. When private interest lobbyists were strong, little or nothing was gained from my work for the public interest. It is too late to start, though if the stars suddenly line up.

I\u2019ve had impressive and unselfish support from University members including staff in several roles, including terms as Chair of Economics, and as Dean of the Faculty of Arts at a time when new graduate programs were initiated in a dozen different departments. As an Adjunct Professor, I am working with consumer-interest researchers in nine different disciplines, with consumer protection agencies and with consumer NGOs and graduate students to produce a Canadian network to help the country use research for evidence-based policies to make a significant improvement in our standard of living. Research interests My research has a focus on consumer economics. Why don\u2019t consumers gain the benefits a competitive economy is supposed to deliver? Can we remove regulations that give favours to special interests yet keep regulations that protect health and safety? Why are there so many scams? Why does shoddy service persist in the market? I learned much from experience in other countries: in the EU and in research institutes and rewarding work with consumer organizations in more than 20 developing countries. My wife Bari and our two sons Rob and Derek never complained: they seemed to thrive in every far-flung location. Particularly rewarding was a span of volunteer advocacy work in Canada- working with others \u2013 to help Canada bring in its Competition Act \u2013 a process that absorbed 13 years. This led to further public interest presentations on consumer issues. In all, I testified more than three dozen occasions as an \u2018expert\u2019 witness at parliamentary hearings and Senate or other enquiries relating to proposed legislation. When private interest lobbyists were strong, little or nothing was gained from my work for the public interest. It is too late to start, though if the stars suddenly line up. Progress was made on many issues: trade policy, metrication, truth-in-pricing, consumption taxes, financial sector transparency and redress. In 1990 I wrote \"Financial Quality and the Consumer Interest\", in the Canadian Banker / Le Banquier and in 1995, \"A Consumer Test for Financial Regulation in Canada,\u201d published in Policy Options / Options Politiques. Right after that I was lucky to be asked to supervise a program of consumer-interest research for the MacKay Task Force on the Future of Canada\u2019s Financial Services Sector. The research on consumer policies in eight countries was published in 1998 in two volumes. That research helped then Finance Minister Paul Martin create Canada\u2019s Financial Consumers Agency (FCAC) in 2001. The FCAC was designed to bring the effectiveness of Canada\u2019s financial services up to the best international level. The evidence shows that consumer-oriented improvements took place right away at Canadian banks and financial institutions. The Office played a role in avoiding the market misconduct problems experienced in the U.S. misconduct (selling \u201cmortgage-backed\u201d securities, for example) that helped provoke the worldwide financial meltdown in 2008. Ireland and other countries followed Canada\u2019s example and a decade later the US created its own Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with much stronger provisions. For the fun and a treasured measure of success I owe sincere thanks to an understanding family, a huge number of collaborators, team mates, colleagues, grad and undergraduate students, friends, administrators and staff supporters.

My PhD focused on gender differences in entry, earnings and duration in self-employment. I also developed a three state wage posting model to predict that if credit constraints are binding for women but not men, the subsequent gender gap in expected self-employment returns could generate a gender gap in wages. More recently I have investigated whether minimum wage regulation affects specific subgroups of the population more than others (i.e. Women versus Men, Immigrant versus Native Born).

I have attempted to evaluate the effects of market structure and competition on retail prices in the gasoline and electricity markets.

Biography I was born in Saskatoon and grew up in Calgary and Montreal. However, I spent my teens and young adult life in Nigeria and India. As a result I was exposed to rather extreme differences in economic conditions and material comforts. I became interested in why people in prosperous countries like Canada could obtain their groceries and household needs from large and clean stores while individuals in less developed countries, had to access tumultuous (and vibrant) bazaars. The acute and chronic poverty I also encountered impacted me, and I began to wonder on what a government could and should do in terms of policy intervention. I saw economics as a natural outlet to answer these questions. Selected publications Sen, Anindya with Nathaniel T. Stevens, Francis Kiwon, Plinio P. Morita, Stefan H.

Biography I was born in Saskatoon and grew up in Calgary and Montreal. However, I spent my teens and young adult life in Nigeria and India. As a result I was exposed to rather extreme differences in economic conditions and material comforts. I became interested in why people in prosperous countries like Canada could obtain their groceries and household needs from large and clean stores while individuals in less developed countries, had to access tumultuous (and vibrant) bazaars. The acute and chronic poverty I also encountered impacted me, and I began to wonder on what a government could and should do in terms of policy intervention.

I have attempted to evaluate the effects of market structure and competition on retail prices in the gasoline and electricity markets. My published research has also focused on assessing the empirical impacts of a wide variety of policies, such as stricter impaired driving laws, mandatory seatbelt legislation, cigarette taxes, and the minimum wage. I am currently studying the effects of deregulating retail alcohol and marijuana markets. \nI believe strongly in the necessity of sharing and communicating research findings with policymakers and the public.

However, I spent my teens and young adult life in Nigeria and India. As a result I was exposed to rather extreme differences in economic conditions and material comforts. I became interested in why people in prosperous countries like Canada could obtain their groceries and household needs from large and clean stores while individuals in less developed countries, had to access tumultuous (and vibrant) bazaars. The acute and chronic poverty I also encountered impacted me, and I began to wonder on what a government could and should do in terms of policy intervention. I saw economics as a natural outlet to answer these questions.\nSelected publications\nSelected publications\n Sen, Anindya with Nathaniel T. Stevens, Francis Kiwon, Plinio P. Morita, Stefan H.

Biography I initially became interested in labour markets, especially in questions about what people are paid for the jobs they do, while working as a high school student in a large warehouse in Mississauga, Ontario employing large numbers of recent immigrants to Canada. My interests led me to McMaster University's undergraduate program in Labour Studies, which provided me with a broad interdisciplinary perspective on labour market issues, with an emphasis on the role that trade unions play in these markets. As part of this program, I was introduced to a sequence of courses in economic theory, as well as field courses in Labour Economics and the Economics of Trade Unions. My recollection is that the formality and rigour of the economic models, which allowed me to exploit my skills in mathematics, appealed to me, which led to a Master's degree in Economics at the University of British Columbia, where I completed two additional courses in Labour Economics. Applying to PhD programs in Economics, I was drawn back to McMaster University by the offer of a generous four-year Doctoral Fellowship, a Faculty with exceptional strength in the area of Labour Economics, and an impatient girlfriend (and soon to be wife). During my PhD studies, completed under the supervision of Peter Kuhn, now of the University of California at Santa Barbara, I began my research on working hours -- looking specifically at the impact of Sunday shopping deregulation on working hours and employment levels in the retail industry -- and on job search -- examining the impact of using the internet to find a job on workers' unemployment durations. Following graduation, I worked for three years in a small research division at Statistics Canada called the Family and Labour Studies Division. This job provided me with an ideal setting for focusing full-time on my research, while accessing confidential Statistics Canada data.

Biography I initially became interested in labour markets, especially in questions about what people are paid for the jobs they do, while working as a high school student in a large warehouse in Mississauga, Ontario employing large numbers of recent immigrants to Canada. My interests led me to McMaster University's undergraduate program in Labour Studies, which provided me with a broad interdisciplinary perspective on labour market issues, with an emphasis on the role that trade unions play in these markets. As part of this program, I was introduced to a sequence of courses in economic theory, as well as field courses in Labour Economics and the Economics of Trade Unions. My recollection is that the formality and rigour of the economic models, which allowed me to exploit my skills in mathematics, appealed to me, which led to a Master's degree in Economics at the University of British Columbia, where I completed two additional courses in Labour Economics. Applying to PhD programs in Economics, I was drawn back to McMaster University by the offer of a generous four-year Doctoral Fellowship, a Faculty with exceptional strength in the area of Labour Economics, and an impatient girlfriend (and soon to be wife). During my PhD studies, completed under the supervision of Peter Kuhn, now of the University of California at Santa Barbara, I began my research on working hours -- looking specifically at the impact of Sunday shopping deregulation on working hours and employment levels in the retail industry -- and on job search -- examining the impact of using the internet to find a job on workers' unemployment durations. Following graduation, I worked for three years in a small research division at Statistics Canada called the Family and Labour Studies Division. This job provided me with an ideal setting for focusing full-time on my research, while accessing confidential Statistics Canada data. It was during this time that my interests in immigration policy and the challenges that many new immigrants face in trying to integrate into Canada's labour markets developed, a topic that continues to occupy much of my research efforts.

I have been at Waterloo since January of 1997. My areas of interest have changed over the years; while I entered my PhD program thinking I would work on early Canadian literature, I was inspired to switch to Renaissance literature by a course called \"Literature and Power in Renaissance England,\" given by Germaine Warkentin, who would become my supervisor. During my graduate training, I found a manuscript of the memoir and diary of Anne Clifford, and went on to edit the diary for my dissertation project (since published in 1995 and in 2006). When I came to UWaterloo I was influenced by the English department\u2019s unique emphasis on the rhetorical dimensions of literary texts and media forms, and my research and teaching of the last twenty years reflects this. My published works includes essays on Behn, Clifford, Milton, Marvell, and Shakespeare, Writing Essays About Literature (Broadview, 2011) and Visual Rhetoric and Early Modern English Literature (Ashgate, 2013).

My areas of interest have changed over the years; while I entered my PhD program thinking I would work on early Canadian literature, I was inspired to switch to Renaissance literature by a course called \"Literature and Power in Renaissance England,\" given by Germaine Warkentin, who would become my supervisor. During my graduate training, I found a manuscript of the memoir and diary of Anne Clifford, and went on to edit the diary for my dissertation project (since published in 1995 and in 2006). When I came to UWaterloo I was influenced by the English department\u2019s unique emphasis on the rhetorical dimensions of literary texts and media forms, and my research and teaching of the last twenty years reflects this. My published works includes essays on Behn, Clifford, Milton, Marvell, and Shakespeare, Writing Essays About Literature (Broadview, 2011) and Visual Rhetoric and Early Modern English Literature (Ashgate, 2013). In 2019 I published a chapter in The Oxford Companion to Marvell(Oxford UP), a chapter in The Edinburgh History of Reading, Volume 1 (Edinburgh UP), and a collection of essays I edited entitled Early Modern English Marginalia (Routledge). The latter included my essay on women's marginalia in the early modern period as a strategic way of occupying space in early modern culture. My current work is on marginalia; I am working on editing a collection of essays about women's marginalia (with Rosalind Smith), and with a team of collaborators I am leading a SSHRC-funded research project called \"The Future of Research in Early Modern Marginalia.\" My undergraduate teaching is primarily in seventeenth-century literature; my graduate courses in recent years have been about book history. My most recent research has been about marginalia, especially by women. I am currently editing a section of The Palgrave Encyclopedia of Early Modern Women's Writing called \"Materialities: Print\" and have commissioned 20 essays that will be published online through 2021 and 2022.

This deposit included the oldest case of battered child syndrome known from the archaeological record.

She then completed a BA and PhD in Anthropology from the University of Tennessee. She pursues research as a skeletal biologist and archaeologist, focusing on the excavation and analysis of human remains and their mortuary contexts. She recently co-authored The Agora Bone Well, a study of a deposit containing 449 infant and fetal skeletons, probably deposited by midwives working in Hellenistic Athens, Greece. This deposit included the oldest case of battered child syndrome known from the archaeological record. Recently she has begun work on a well from the Swiss excavations at Eretria, Greece that also has a large number of infant skeletons in the fill and promises to provide an important comparison to the Agora well. She also is currently documenting skeletons from an early Christian cemetery found in in the Sanctuary of Ismenian Apollo in Thebes. This cemetery was associated with an early hospice or hospital; many of the individuals buried there suffered from leprosy. She welcomes inquiries from graduate students who would like to carry out research in these areas. Selected Publications L. P. Day and M.A. Liston, et al.

Informed by contemporary social and archaeological theory, as well as Indigenous collaboration and scholarship, his research highlights how Woodland people, places, and things emerged in tandem with one another through various contextually dependent associations. In this vein, he is concerned with developing archaeological approaches that attend to such processes, be they at work in the materialization of sites, features, or assemblages. Prior to joining the Department, Dr. Watts held postdoctoral fellowships at the Royal Ontario Museum and the University of Western Ontario, and worked as an archaeologist in both the commercial and regulatory sectors. His past research has explored the agentive/animistic qualities of ceramic artifacts, notions of food collection vs. production, and the experiential aspects of longhouse life among Ontario Iroquoian groups. Currently, his field research focuses on Woodland Period earthen enclosures in southwestern Ontario, including field investigations in Essex Co., while his collections-based projects centre on design elements in Woodland pottery, smoking pipes, and other items.

CE 1-1550) cultural traditions of the lower Great Lakes. Informed by contemporary social and archaeological theory, as well as Indigenous collaboration and scholarship, his research highlights how Woodland people, places, and things emerged in tandem with one another through various contextually dependent associations. In this vein, he is concerned with developing archaeological approaches that attend to such processes, be they at work in the materialization of sites, features, or assemblages. Prior to joining the Department, Dr. Watts held postdoctoral fellowships at the Royal Ontario Museum and the University of Western Ontario, and worked as an archaeologist in both the commercial and regulatory sectors. His past research has explored the agentive/animistic qualities of ceramic artifacts, notions of food collection vs. production, and the experiential aspects of longhouse life among Ontario Iroquoian groups. Currently, his field research focuses on Woodland Period earthen enclosures in southwestern Ontario, including field investigations in Essex Co., while his collections-based projects centre on design elements in Woodland pottery, smoking pipes, and other items. Dr. Watts welcomes students who are interested in pursuing graduate studies as part of Waterloo\u2019s MA in Public Issues Anthropology. See here for more information. Some of the courses Dr. Watts teaches include: ANTH 201 Introduction to Archaeology ANTH 309 Archaeology of North America ANTH 322 Archaeology of the Great Lakes Area ANTH 372 Archaeological Field School ANTH 415 Archaeologies of Landscape ANTH 489 Approaches to Ancient Art (Special Topic - Winter 2024) Recent Publications Watts, C.

I am also interested in understanding how the unemployment insurance system affects individuals\u2019 post-unemployment outcomes (type of job, pay and benefits). My work builds on empirically estimating theoretical predictions about firms\u2019 organizational choices and workers\u2019 occupational mobility decisions using data from Canada, the U.S. and Germany. The main results show substantial differences between men and women\u2019s choices and outcomes and between young and old firms, and firms of different sizes. Biography While my family name is originally from Catalonia, I was born in France. I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at the University Paris VII and Paris I, studying Mathematics and its application to different Social Sciences. I chose to further study economics because I find the idea of applying rigorous tools and approaches to subjects (individuals, firms or governments) and contexts affected by uncertainty challenging and fascinating. I developed an interest in the field of labour economics in France when at some point, all of my family members ended up unemployed and not so unhappy about it. I did my PhD in Canada, at the University of Montreal and also visiting the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. I also spent some time in Barcelona and worked in the U.S. at the University of Minnesota for 5 years before joining the University of Waterloo. Experiencing multiple changes of address, some of my work reflects my vested interest in understanding individuals' mobility decisions.

I chose to further study economics because I find the idea of applying rigorous tools and approaches to subjects (individuals, firms or governments) and contexts affected by uncertainty challenging and fascinating. I developed an interest in the field of labour economics in France when at some point, all of my family members ended up unemployed and not so unhappy about it. I did my PhD in Canada, at the University of Montreal and also visiting the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. I also spent some time in Barcelona and worked in the U.S. at the University of Minnesota for 5 years before joining the University of Waterloo. Experiencing multiple changes of address, some of my work reflects my vested interest in understanding individuals' mobility decisions.

My role as a lecturer is significant in that I have the privilege of influencing our future by equipping our students with the knowledge to succeed and by challenging them to make a difference. I apply the principles of transformational leadership in the classroom. This means treating each student individually and providing vigorous intellectual stimulation through practice. It also means not accepting but challenging the status quo and engendering faith, trust and respect. As an instructor my responsibilities are to stretch the mind, raise confidence and retain humility. I also help students to hone skills associated with problem solving, critical thinking, decision making, teamwork, communication, and conflict resolution. What are your research or special interests? Of great interest to me is working with aspiring students, especially those attempting to start a business or a social enterprise. I am a strong advocate for economic and social prosperity in Canada and continue to work to support professionals in economic development. Family enterprise remains a passion. Part of my past work experience is in family enterprise. My thesis focused on the relationship between family and family business. Strategy remains at the core of all organizations. Working with firms in a variety of sectors allows me to bring these real cases into the classroom. What impression do you receive from Waterloo students? Waterloo students continue to WOW me. They bring diversity, add to the unique UW culture, have a strong work ethic and are connected to our global community. The spirit of \u2018can do\u2019 resonates in each student irrespective of faculty. I see young champions who are much more than students. While busy maintaining their responsibilities in the classroom, many are investing in a better tomorrow.

Using economic modelling, I have been studying the interplay between environmental and trade policies related to the eco-industry, as well as the market structure of this industry. More recently, my research interests have widened to include issues related to trade and environment in developing countries, with a focus on the analysis of the effectiveness of green foreign aid. Another recent research interest of mine is the study of the effects of market power in the Canadian gasoline industry. Biography I grew up in Bujumbura (Burundi) and studied economics at the Universit\u00e9 du Burundi. Thanks to a scholarship for academic excellence received from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), I was able to pursue my MSc studies at HEC Montr\u00e9al (affiliated with the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al). I went on to complete my PhD in applied economics at the same institution on a Trudeau Scholarship. Due to my personal background as a native of a developing country, my early research interests were in development economics. I have conducted empirical and theoretical research related to structural adjustment programs and intergenerational education mobility in sub-Saharan Africa. Although I remain interested in development issues, I decided to specialize in environmental economics during my PhD studies.

Research interests I am interested in studying the effects of entry on the efficiency of different types of market structures. In particular, the conditions under which entry creates inefficiencies in oligopoly markets when firms engage in either Cournot (quantity) or Bertrand (price) competition. In my dissertation, I examined the effects of free entry in Cournot markets. Inefficiencies arise when entry is free and firms differ in their cost structures. It is only in the presence of non-identical firms that studying the inefficiencies created by free entry becomes an interesting problem. Entry biases are calculated by comparing the equilibrium number of firms with free entry to social optimum number of firms. These comparisons are valid in both homogeneous and non-homogeneous good markets. Biography I completed my graduate studies at the University of Missouri-Columbia in the United States. Given that my undergraduate degree is in mathematics, my interests were divided between mathematics, economics and business including marketing and finance. In order to explore these areas, I took classes from business school, mathematical sciences and economics. As a result, I ended up having a Master degree in Applied Mathematics and an MBA degree in addition to a Ph.D. in Economics. Based on my diverse background, I am competent in teaching courses not only in economics but also in marketing, finance and mathematics. I taught classes at full time appointments at Wilfrid Laurier University and McMaster University before coming to University of Waterloo. Some of the courses I taught and have been teaching include Microeconomics, Mathematical Economics, Game Theory, Economics of the Canadian Banking and Financial System, Marketing, Business Finance, Development Economics, and College Algebra for calculus bound students. There are three main factors that guide my teaching philosophy. My lectures are designed to promote critical thinking and to engage my students in active learning. I relate the material covered in class to real world applications to allow students to see the applicability of the material covered in class so that they can later apply what they have been taught in their jobs. I have also strived to give my students the ability and desire to be curious about the world around them and have always aimed to give them the skills they need to pursue their dreams to explore the world around them so that they can build the future they desire. \n omesta@uwaterloo.ca 519-888-4567 x46559 Office: HH 221 CV: Olivia Ozlem Mesta BSc Mathematics (Istanbul University); MSc Mathematical Engineering (Istanbul Technical University); MBA, MSc Applied Mathematics, MA Economics, PhD Economics (University of Missouri) Areas of specialization: Microeconomics; Mathematical Economics; Industrial Organization; Marketing, Business Economics; Financial Economics.
