Professor Ho and his PhD student Dr. James She invented Wireless Media Express\u2122 to rectify the problem of \u2018wireless channel fading\u2019. Wireless channel fading is the intrinsic wireless communication systems problem that limits wireless service providers from effectively multicasting to intended receivers. Wireless Media Express\u2122 generates an intelligent multicast signal that maximizes the video quality for all intended receivers, regardless of receiver channel quality status. This technology will allow users to have access to TV channels on handheld devices while watching consistent high quality live broadcasting. It also gives a business owner the capability of conveniently uploading video advertising materials to different digital displays throughout a city (highway billboards, shopping mall displays, subway station terminals) all in one shot and targeted to different \u201ctime of day\u201d audiences.\nResearch interests\n Vehicular communications Wireless network security Cross-layer design Coded video multicasting MAC layer scheduling & performance analysis High availability design Integration of fiber and wireless Communication systems (FiWi) Information Systems Cloud technology Embedded systems Connectivity and Internet of Things Wireless communications/networking Optical network survivability Coded video multicasting Cognitive and femtocell networks Cybersecurity Infrastructure integrity IoT Communications and Access Application Domains Networking and Data \nVehicular communications\nWireless network security\nCross-layer design\nCoded video multicasting\nMAC layer scheduling & performance analysis\nHigh availability design\nIntegration of fiber and wireless\nCommunication systems (FiWi)\nInformation Systems\nCloud technology\nEmbedded systems\nConnectivity and Internet of Things\nWireless communications/networking\nOptical network survivability\nCoded video multicasting\nCognitive and femtocell networks\nCybersecurity\nInfrastructure integrity\nIoT\nCommunications and Access\nApplication Domains\nNetworking and Data\nEducation\n 2002, Doctorate, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University 2000, Master of Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University 1995, Master of Science, Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University 1993, Bachelor of Science (BSc), Electrical Engineering, Naional Taiwan University \n 2002, Doctorate, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University \n 2000, Master of Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University \n 1995, Master of Science, Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University \n 1993, Bachelor of Science (BSc), Electrical Engineering, Naional Taiwan University \nCourses*\n ECE 124 -

His research group focuses on understanding physics of non-equilibrium phenomena in nanosystems with relevance to device applications by means of modeling and simulations. Building on rigorous fundamental understanding, he has developed his own quantum transport simulator using Non-Equilibrium Green\u2019s Function (NEGF) method. Atomistic simulations may enable predictive analysis of nanoscale devices for which direct experimental investigation can often be extremely challenging and prohibitively expensive. \n \nHe received his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Florida (Gainesville, FL) in 2008, where his research mainly focused on ballistic transport in carbon nanotube devices. Then he worked as a postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley where he has done pioneering work in the field of non-equilibrium quantum transport, including the first demonstration of dissipative simulation using the NEGF formalism for the realistic size of devices (>200 nm) and the first-ever trial that included both phonon and roughness scattering for graphene nanoribbon transistors.\nResearch interests\n Nanoscale transistors and sensors Computer simulations for emerging devices Engineering tool development for analysis and optimization \nNanoscale transistors and sensors\nComputer simulations for emerging devices\nEngineering tool development for analysis and optimization\nEducation\n 2008, Doctorate, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida 2005, Master of Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida 1999, Bachelor of Engineering, Materials Science & Engineering, Korea University \n 2008, Doctorate, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida \n 2005, Master of Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida \n 1999, Bachelor of Engineering, Materials Science & Engineering, Korea University \nCourses*\n ECE 633 - NanoelectronicsTaught in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 NE 102 - Introduction to Nanomaterials Health Risk; Nanotechnology Engineering PracticeTaught in 2019 NE 131 - Physics for Nanotechnology EngineeringTaught in 2019, 2020, 2023 NE 201 - Nanotoxicology; Nanotechnology Engineering PracticeTaught in 2019 NE 202 - Nanomaterials and Environmental Impact; Nanotechnology Engineering PracticeTaught in 2020 NE 242 - Semiconductor Physics and DevicesTaught in 2021, 2022 NE 301 - Nanomaterials and Human Risks, Benefits; Nanotechnology Engineering PracticeTaught in 2021 NE 471 - Nano-electronicsTaught in 2021, 2022, 2023 \nECE 633 - NanoelectronicsTaught in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\nTaught in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\nTaught in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\nNE 102 - Introduction to Nanomaterials Health Risk; Nanotechnology Engineering PracticeTaught in 2019\nTaught in 2019\nTaught in 2019\nNE 131 - Physics for Nanotechnology EngineeringTaught in 2019, 2020, 2023\nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2023\nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2023\nNE 201 - Nanotoxicology; Nanotechnology Engineering PracticeTaught in 2019\nTaught in 2019\nTaught in 2019\nNE 202 - Nanomaterials and Environmental Impact; Nanotechnology Engineering PracticeTaught in 2020\nTaught in 2020\nTaught in 2020\nNE 242 - Semiconductor Physics and DevicesTaught in 2021, 2022\nTaught in 2021, 2022\nTaught in 2021, 2022\nNE 301 - Nanomaterials and Human Risks, Benefits; Nanotechnology Engineering PracticeTaught in 2021\nTaught in 2021\nTaught in 2021\nNE 471 - Nano-electronicsTaught in 2021, 2022, 2023\nTaught in 2021, 2022, 2023\nTaught in 2021, 2022, 2023\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\nSelected/recent publications\n Yin, Demin and Yoon, Youngki, Design strategy of two-dimensional material field-effect transistors: Engineering the number of layers in phosphorene FETs, Journal of Applied Physics, 119(21), 2016 Kwon, Junyeon and Hong, Seongin and Hong, Young Ki and Lee, Sungho and Yoo, Geonwook and Yoon, Youngki and Kim, Sunkook, Photosensitivity enhancement in hydrogenated amorphous silicon thin-film phototransistors with gate underlap, Applied Physics Letters, 107(20), 2015 Yin, Demin and Han, Gyuchull and Yoon, Youngki, Scaling Limit of Bilayer Phosphorene FETs, IEEE Electron Device Letters, 36(9), 2015, 978 - 980 Jung, Chulseung and Kim, Seung Min and Moon, Hyunseong and Han, Gyuchull and Kwon, Junyeon and Hong, Young Ki and Omkaram, Inturu and Yoon, Youngki and Kim, Sunkook and Park, Jozeph, Highly Crystalline CVD-grown Multilayer MoSe2 Thin Film Transistor for Fast Photodetector, Scientific reports, 5, 2015 Kwon, Junyeon and Hong, Young Ki and Han, Gyuchull and Omkaram, Inturu and Choi, Woong and Kim, Sunkook and Yoon, Youngki, Phototransistors: Giant Photoamplification in Indirect-Bandgap Multilayer MoS2 Phototransistors with Local Bottom-Gate Structures (Adv.

I am also cross-appointed in the Department of Systems Design Engineering and the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science. My research goal is to design, develop and evaluate technology that can support new ways of interacting with computers and information. A central part of this goal is my interest in providing the ability for richer and faster interaction through the use of one's body, hands, and fingers. The demand for effective interaction is increasing in response to the recent surge in commercial and research hardware that supports the sensing of more and more information about human movement in and around the surfaces ubiquitous in our everyday environment. While this technology has made it possible to interact in interesting and new ways, and even to carry this technology with us everywhere that we go, we have only begun to scratch the surface of what is possible and tend to rely on simple interaction, such as buttons and menus to interact with these new devices. My primary motivation is to harness some of the richness of interaction that is possible with our hands and bodies in how we interact with computers. In my research, I consider the fundamental nature of human movement and perception to help inform the design of interaction for new media.

Professor Miao's research interests lie in spintronics, which use precise electron spin manipulation for information processing. His work places a strong emphasis on nanodevices established on newly emerging spin platforms, such as synthetic diamonds and topological insulators, where information can be processed coherently on the quantum level, rather than digitally on the classical level.

With my students and colleagues, I have used field studies to investigate design decision-making, product development, and communication and coordination in organizations. We have also used lab experiments to investigate individual and group problem solving, decision-making under subjective probability, and other aspects of human communication and cognition. Recently we have been exploring the use of machine learning/AI to model complex decision problems, as well as the behavioural effects of these tools.

With my students and colleagues, I have used field studies to investigate design decision-making, product development, and communication and coordination in organizations. We have also used lab experiments to investigate individual and group problem solving, decision-making under subjective probability, and other aspects of human communication and cognition. Recently we have been exploring the use of machine learning/AI to model complex decision problems, as well as the behavioural effects of these tools.
