Most of the time I study games and play. I'm particularly interested in the shifting production models of the global game industry, and tracing how risk management practices, datamining, and digital distribution shape developers' creative work and the larger cultural role of games. Predominantly, I carry out ethnographic work inside game studios. I use the example of the game industry to show how the design, deployment, and use of communication software is shaped by economic, social, technological and political concerns, which then create certain constraints and affordances in how people can use these technologies. For example, some of my work on gamification traces how governance and control are designed into games, smartphones, and websites, and how playful rationalities are used to shape use behaviour and thus govern through freedom rather than fear and risk.

Most of the time I study games and play. I'm particularly interested in the shifting production models of the global game industry, and tracing how risk management practices, datamining, and digital distribution shape developers' creative work and the larger cultural role of games. Predominantly, I carry out ethnographic work inside game studios. I use the example of the game industry to show how the design, deployment, and use of communication software is shaped by economic, social, technological and political concerns, which then create certain constraints and affordances in how people can use these technologies. For example, some of my work on gamification traces how governance and control are designed into games, smartphones, and websites, and how playful rationalities are used to shape use behaviour and thus govern through freedom rather than fear and risk.

Frequently asked questions 1. Are you taking a student next year? Yes, I plan to take one new student next year. 2. Should I contact faculty in the Clinical Area to ask whether or not they are taking a student, or to alert them to my application? No, this is not at all necessary. Our website indicates which faculty are taking students. Out of fairness we do not evaluate or \u201cearmark\u201d applicants outside of our admissions process, which begins after the application deadline. 3. What do we look for in a student? We look for students who are intellectually curious, who enjoy discovery and who love sharing their discoveries with the world. 4. How can I make my application more competitive? \u00b7 We receive about 150 applications per year for 4-6 positions in our program. Our first cut is based on your marks in Psychology courses and on GRE scores, so, keep working hard! \u00b7 Avoid using a generic statement. Instead, use your statement to explain how your research interests are a good match for the person at UW in whom you are interested in working. If you present a generic statement it is a lot harder for us to tell whether you are a good fit for our program and for the lab you are interested in joining. \u00b7 Tell us about your honours thesis research in your statement. Don\u2019t just tell us what you did, but let us know what question piqued your curiosity, how you studied it, and how your findings will help us better understand the phenomenon you studied. \u00b7 Apply for external funding at the same time you are applying to graduate school. This will help you better identify and articulate your research interests, both for yourself and for us. If you receive funding it removes the burden of having to apply for external funding in your first weeks of a very challenging program. 5. What if the research I outline in my application for external funding doesn\u2019t seem to fit directly into the work that you (or others at UW) are doing? All research is informed by general underlying questions (e.g., why do unwanted thoughts persist?) even if the research questions themselves are quite specific (e.g., what is the effect of a mood manipulation on perceived self-worth?). As long as the general questions that interest you fit with the work of your potential supervisor you will be in good shape to work together. What is it like to work with me? This is what my current and recent students have to say! \u201cI am profoundly appreciative of the time I have spent working with Dr. Purdon; it has been a supportive, productive, enriching, and rewarding growing experience, rife with opportunities (papers, book chapters, conference presentations, etc.) and support when I have been in need. I feel assured that we will collaborate and remain in touch beyond the scope of my graduate training; to you, Christine, my heartfelt thanks!\u201d -Brenda, Residency year \u201cChristine provides her students with a great balance of support and independence. She expresses a genuine interest in the wellbeing of her students and her research and clinical expertise are a phenomenal resource.\u201d -Jasmine, Pre-Residency year \u201cChristine is always available whether you want to chat about research, clinical work, or navigating through graduate school! She enables her students to build a personalized program of research!\u201d -Mengran Xu, Residency year (PhD defended) \"Christine cares about the needs of her students, and our lab space is unique and ideal for studying OCD\". -Olivia, First year PhD \n BA(Hon) University of Western Ontario MA University of New Brunswick PhD University of New Brunswick Co- Director, UWaterloo Anxiety Studies (Find out about our current studies!)

Out of fairness we do not evaluate or \u201cearmark\u201d applicants outside of our admissions process, which begins after the application deadline. 3. What do we look for in a student? We look for students who are intellectually curious, who enjoy discovery and who love sharing their discoveries with the world. 4. How can I make my application more competitive? \u00b7 We receive about 150 applications per year for 4-6 positions in our program. Our first cut is based on your marks in Psychology courses and on GRE scores, so, keep working hard! \u00b7 Avoid using a generic statement. Instead, use your statement to explain how your research interests are a good match for the person at UW in whom you are interested in working. If you present a generic statement it is a lot harder for us to tell whether you are a good fit for our program and for the lab you are interested in joining. \u00b7 Tell us about your honours thesis research in your statement. Don\u2019t just tell us what you did, but let us know what question piqued your curiosity, how you studied it, and how your findings will help us better understand the phenomenon you studied. \u00b7 Apply for external funding at the same time you are applying to graduate school. This will help you better identify and articulate your research interests, both for yourself and for us. If you receive funding it removes the burden of having to apply for external funding in your first weeks of a very challenging program. 5. What if the research I outline in my application for external funding doesn\u2019t seem to fit directly into the work that you (or others at UW) are doing? All research is informed by general underlying questions (e.g., why do unwanted thoughts persist?) even if the research questions themselves are quite specific (e.g., what is the effect of a mood manipulation on perceived self-worth?). As long as the general questions that interest you fit with the work of your potential supervisor you will be in good shape to work together. What is it like to work with me? This is what my current and recent students have to say! \u201cI am profoundly appreciative of the time I have spent working with Dr. Purdon; it has been a supportive, productive, enriching, and rewarding growing experience, rife with opportunities (papers, book chapters, conference presentations, etc.) and support when I have been in need.

Frequently asked questions 1. Are you taking a student next year? Yes, I plan to take one new student next year. 2. Should I contact faculty in the Clinical Area to ask whether or not they are taking a student, or to alert them to my application? No, this is not at all necessary. Our website indicates which faculty are taking students. Out of fairness we do not evaluate or \u201cearmark\u201d applicants outside of our admissions process, which begins after the application deadline. 3. What do we look for in a student? We look for students who are intellectually curious, who enjoy discovery and who love sharing their discoveries with the world. 4. How can I make my application more competitive? \u00b7 We receive about 150 applications per year for 4-6 positions in our program. Our first cut is based on your marks in Psychology courses and on GRE scores, so, keep working hard! \u00b7 Avoid using a generic statement. Instead, use your statement to explain how your research interests are a good match for the person at UW in whom you are interested in working. If you present a generic statement it is a lot harder for us to tell whether you are a good fit for our program and for the lab you are interested in joining. \u00b7 Tell us about your honours thesis research in your statement. Don\u2019t just tell us what you did, but let us know what question piqued your curiosity, how you studied it, and how your findings will help us better understand the phenomenon you studied. \u00b7 Apply for external funding at the same time you are applying to graduate school. This will help you better identify and articulate your research interests, both for yourself and for us. If you receive funding it removes the burden of having to apply for external funding in your first weeks of a very challenging program. 5. What if the research I outline in my application for external funding doesn\u2019t seem to fit directly into the work that you (or others at UW) are doing? All research is informed by general underlying questions (e.g., why do unwanted thoughts persist?) even if the research questions themselves are quite specific (e.g., what is the effect of a mood manipulation on perceived self-worth?). As long as the general questions that interest you fit with the work of your potential supervisor you will be in good shape to work together. What is it like to work with me? This is what my current and recent students have to say! \u201cI am profoundly appreciative of the time I have spent working with Dr. Purdon; it has been a supportive, productive, enriching, and rewarding growing experience, rife with opportunities (papers, book chapters, conference presentations, etc.) and support when I have been in need. I feel assured that we will collaborate and remain in touch beyond the scope of my graduate training; to you, Christine, my heartfelt thanks!\u201d -Brenda, Residency year \u201cChristine provides her students with a great balance of support and independence.

Are you taking a student next year?\nYes, I plan to take one new student next year.\n2. Should I contact faculty in the Clinical Area to ask whether or not they are taking a student, or to alert them to my application?\nNo, this is not at all necessary. Our website indicates which faculty are taking students. Out of fairness we do not evaluate or \u201cearmark\u201d applicants outside of our admissions process, which begins after the application deadline.\n3. What do we look for in a student?\nWe look for students who are intellectually curious, who enjoy discovery and who love sharing their discoveries with the world.\n4. How can I make my application more competitive?\n\u00b7 We receive about 150 applications per year for 4-6 positions in our program. Our first cut is based on your marks in Psychology courses and on GRE scores, so, keep working hard!\n\u00b7 Avoid using a generic statement. Instead, use your statement to explain how your research interests are a good match for the person at UW in whom you are interested in working. If you present a generic statement it is a lot harder for us to tell whether you are a good fit for our program and for the lab you are interested in joining.\n\u00b7 Tell us about your honours thesis research in your statement. Don\u2019t just tell us what you did, but let us know what question piqued your curiosity, how you studied it, and how your findings will help us better understand the phenomenon you studied.\n\u00b7 Apply for external funding at the same time you are applying to graduate school. This will help you better identify and articulate your research interests, both for yourself and for us. If you receive funding it removes the burden of having to apply for external funding in your first weeks of a very challenging program.\n5. What if the research I outline in my application for external funding doesn\u2019t seem to fit directly into the work that you (or others at UW) are doing?\nAll research is informed by general underlying questions (e.g., why do unwanted thoughts persist?) even if the research questions themselves are quite specific (e.g., what is the effect of a mood manipulation on perceived self-worth?). As long as the general questions that interest you fit with the work of your potential supervisor you will be in good shape to work together.\n What is it like to work with me?\n What is it like to work with me?\n \nThis is what my current and recent students have to say!\n\u201cI am profoundly appreciative of the time I have spent working with Dr. Purdon; it has been a supportive, productive, enriching, and rewarding growing experience, rife with opportunities (papers, book chapters, conference presentations, etc.) and support when I have been in need. I feel assured that we will collaborate and remain in touch beyond the scope of my graduate training; to you, Christine, my heartfelt thanks!\u201d\n-Brenda, Residency year\n\u201cChristine provides her students with a great balance of support and independence. She expresses a genuine interest in the wellbeing of her students and her research and clinical expertise are a phenomenal resource.\u201d\n-Jasmine, Pre-Residency year\n\u201cChristine is always available whether you want to chat about research, clinical work, or navigating through graduate school! She enables her students to build a personalized program of research!\u201d\n-Mengran Xu, Residency year (PhD defended)\n\"Christine cares about the needs of her students, and our lab space is unique and ideal for studying OCD\".\n-Olivia, First year PhD\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n Faculty \n Faculty \n Faculty \nFaculty"}, {"profile": "https://experts.uwaterloo.ca/uzma-rehman", "name": "Uzma Rehman", "position": "Associate Professor  Faculty of Arts Department of Psychology ", "email": "rehman@uwaterloo.ca", "expertise": ["Human sexuality", "Intimate relationships", "Romantic relationships"], "bio": " Associate Professor \n Associate Professor \n BA, International University; PhD, Indiana University Contact information The Relationship Research Lab website I will be accepting a new graduate student for 2022 Research interests My research is in the area of human sexuality; I focus specifically on factors that promote or hinder healthy and open sexual communication between partners. In one line of my research, I investigate the role of emotional avoidance in sexual communication. That is, to what extent does the motivation to avoid certain emotional states, such as shame and guilt, influence the quality of sexual communication between partners. In this research, the role of emotional avoidance is also compared to other factors, such as skills deficits or knowledge deficits. In a related area of research, I examine how an individual\u2019s working models of intimacy and attachment needs influence the course and types of sexual difficulties they experience in their current relationship.

What are the mechanisms by which poor body image influences sexual satisfaction and pleasure?

In one line of my research, I investigate the role of emotional avoidance in sexual communication. That is, to what extent does the motivation to avoid certain emotional states, such as shame and guilt, influence the quality of sexual communication between partners. In this research, the role of emotional avoidance is also compared to other factors, such as skills deficits or knowledge deficits. In a related area of research, I examine how an individual\u2019s working models of intimacy and attachment needs influence the course and types of sexual difficulties they experience in their current relationship. Below are some of the research projects currently underway in my lab: What is the role of emotional avoidance in safer sex communication and sexual consent processes? What are the mechanisms by which poor body image influences sexual satisfaction and pleasure? Is low sexual desire in women better conceptualized as a singular phenomenon or are there distinct subtypes of women with low desire? What are the emotional mechanisms that link early childhood sexual trauma to current sexual functioning?

Hons. with Distinction (Queen\u2019s), M.Sc., Ph.D. (Western) Contact information Profile I received my Honour\u2019s B.Sc. with Distinction from Queen\u2019s University, and M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of Western Ontario in 2007 and 2013, respectively. I am a Registered Psychologist with the College of Psychologists of Ontario (CPO). Teaching interests I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in Clinical Psychology. I also supervise practicum students in the Clinical Psychology graduate program. I am passionate about my role as teacher, supervisor, and mentor, and strive to help students in whatever ways I can. Fall 2021 PSYCH 389 - Social Science Advanced Research Methods: Research Methods in Personality and Clinical Psychology PSYCH 717 - Psychological Assessment I Winter 2022 PSYCH 317 - Child Psychopathology PSYCH 336 - Introduction to Clinical Psychology PSYCH 718 - Psychological Assessment II Clinical interests Previously, I have worked in a variety of mental health and behavioural medicine/health psychology settings working individuals ages 0 to 85, including Vanier Children\u2019s Services, the Child and Parent Resource Institute, London Health Sciences Centre, and St. Joseph\u2019s Health Care London. Most recently, I completed my Predoctoral Internship in Clinical Psychology (Child and Family Track) at Hamilton Health Sciences. I currently am involved in teaching clinical psychology graduate students psychological assessment methods and supervising students providing assessment and psychotherapy services at the uWaterloo Centre for Mental Health Research. I also work in private practice in the community, where I conduct psychological assessments and psychotherapy with children, adolescents, and adults. Clinically, I incorporate several theoretical perspectives including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, Developmental Psychopathology, Attachment/Relational Theory, and Family Systems Approaches. Research interests My primary research interest is exploring the role of cognition and life stress in depression. My master\u2019s thesis examined self-schema organization as a predictor of cognitive reactivity to a laboratory-based mood induction. My dissertation work examined the effect of interpretive biases on the generation of life stress in the context of depression. Other research interests include exploring diathesis-stress and stress generation models of depression using self-schema organization as a cognitive vulnerability factor, the influence of social support on the adversity, stress, and depression relationship, and the developmental origins of cognitive vulnerability to depression. I am also interested in the impact of early relationships with caregivers (i.e., attachment styles) and childhood trauma, and how these influence the subsequent experience of life stress and internalizing difficulties.

Hons. with Distinction (Queen\u2019s), M.Sc., Ph.D. (Western) Contact information Profile I received my Honour\u2019s B.Sc. with Distinction from Queen\u2019s University, and M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of Western Ontario in 2007 and 2013, respectively. I am a Registered Psychologist with the College of Psychologists of Ontario (CPO). Teaching interests I teach undergraduate and graduate courses in Clinical Psychology. I also supervise practicum students in the Clinical Psychology graduate program. I am passionate about my role as teacher, supervisor, and mentor, and strive to help students in whatever ways I can. Fall 2021 PSYCH 389 - Social Science Advanced Research Methods: Research Methods in Personality and Clinical Psychology PSYCH 717 - Psychological Assessment I Winter 2022 PSYCH 317 - Child Psychopathology PSYCH 336 - Introduction to Clinical Psychology PSYCH 718 - Psychological Assessment II Clinical interests Previously, I have worked in a variety of mental health and behavioural medicine/health psychology settings working individuals ages 0 to 85, including Vanier Children\u2019s Services, the Child and Parent Resource Institute, London Health Sciences Centre, and St. Joseph\u2019s Health Care London. Most recently, I completed my Predoctoral Internship in Clinical Psychology (Child and Family Track) at Hamilton Health Sciences. I currently am involved in teaching clinical psychology graduate students psychological assessment methods and supervising students providing assessment and psychotherapy services at the uWaterloo Centre for Mental Health Research. I also work in private practice in the community, where I conduct psychological assessments and psychotherapy with children, adolescents, and adults. Clinically, I incorporate several theoretical perspectives including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, Developmental Psychopathology, Attachment/Relational Theory, and Family Systems Approaches. Research interests My primary research interest is exploring the role of cognition and life stress in depression. My master\u2019s thesis examined self-schema organization as a predictor of cognitive reactivity to a laboratory-based mood induction. My dissertation work examined the effect of interpretive biases on the generation of life stress in the context of depression. Other research interests include exploring diathesis-stress and stress generation models of depression using self-schema organization as a cognitive vulnerability factor, the influence of social support on the adversity, stress, and depression relationship, and the developmental origins of cognitive vulnerability to depression. I am also interested in the impact of early relationships with caregivers (i.e., attachment styles) and childhood trauma, and how these influence the subsequent experience of life stress and internalizing difficulties.

My students and I have explored various aspects of attentional engagement, such as (1) the ubiquitous experience of mind wandering, (2) sustained attention to tasks over protracted periods of time (i.e., vigilance), (3) attention-related errors, (4) media multitasking, and (5) peak engagement (i.e., flow). We have examined these aspects of attention in tightly controlled experimental settings, as well as in more naturalistic everyday contexts (e.g., live undergraduate lectures). Our focus has been on proposing and testing theories of human attention, as well as on developing a practical understanding of how people engage with the world around them.

My research also extends financial accounting perspectives to research issues in other disciplines such as finance, information systems, and auditing. In particular, my research topics include accounting conservatism, managerial discretion in financial reporting, goodwill impairment, post-earnings-announcement drift, accounting for executive stock options, and the role of fair value accounting in the recent financial crisis among others.

She is interested in the ways contemporary Black women and youth define and organize against multiple forms of violence while contesting carceral ideologies, institutions, and imaginaries. Her work interrogates how narratives of violence and safety are shaped and reshaped into popular discourse, public policy, and collective praxis. She also maintains a strong interest in the ways liberatory Christian theologies nourish resistance to violence and injustice in the Global South and its North American Diasporas. She is currently at work on a book project on the intersections of restorative justice and womanist theology. As a trainer, scholar, board member, convenor, and co-learner, she has contributed to numerous social justice and community development organizations, and to collaborations, delegations, and multi-disciplinary projects around the world. She currently serves on the advisory board of Life Comes From It, a U.S.-based grantmaking circle for restorative justice, transformative justice, and Indigenous peacemaking initiatives led by Black, Indigenous, People of Color.

She is interested in the ways contemporary Black women and youth define and organize against multiple forms of violence while contesting carceral ideologies, institutions, and imaginaries. Her work interrogates how narratives of violence and safety are shaped and reshaped into popular discourse, public policy, and collective praxis. She also maintains a strong interest in the ways liberatory Christian theologies nourish resistance to violence and injustice in the Global South and its North American Diasporas. She is currently at work on a book project on the intersections of restorative justice and womanist theology. As a trainer, scholar, board member, convenor, and co-learner, she has contributed to numerous social justice and community development organizations, and to collaborations, delegations, and multi-disciplinary projects around the world.

She is interested in the ways contemporary Black women and youth define and organize against multiple forms of violence while contesting carceral ideologies, institutions, and imaginaries. Her work interrogates how narratives of violence and safety are shaped and reshaped into popular discourse, public policy, and collective praxis. She also maintains a strong interest in the ways liberatory Christian theologies nourish resistance to violence and injustice in the Global South and its North American Diasporas. She is currently at work on a book project on the intersections of restorative justice and womanist theology. As a trainer, scholar, board member, convenor, and co-learner, she has contributed to numerous social justice and community development organizations, and to collaborations, delegations, and multi-disciplinary projects around the world. She currently serves on the advisory board of Life Comes From It, a U.S.-based grantmaking circle for restorative justice, transformative justice, and Indigenous peacemaking initiatives led by Black, Indigenous, People of Color.

His research interests include church apologies for historical wrongs, martyrdom, ecclesiology, ecumenism, the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, and contemporary Mennonite theology. In his book Ecclesial Repentance: The Churches Confront Their Sinful Pasts (T&T Clark, 2011) he analyzed over 100 instances of churches apologizing for historical wrongs and proposed a theological framework for understanding this relatively new practice. His current research project is a critical examination of the claim that Christian martyrdom advances the unity of otherwise divided churches. Jeremy has been on faculty at Grebel since 2008, and was the Director of Theological Studies from 2014-2021. He has served as Director of the Toronto Mennonite Theological Centre, Editor of The Conrad Grebel Review and was President of the Canadian Theological Society, 2016-2017.

Web Page: http://uwaterloo.academia.edu/JeremyBergen \n About: Jeremy Bergen teaches and writes in the area of contemporary Christian theology. His research interests include church apologies for historical wrongs, martyrdom, ecclesiology, ecumenism, the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, and contemporary Mennonite theology. In his book Ecclesial Repentance: The Churches Confront Their Sinful Pasts (T&T Clark, 2011) he analyzed over 100 instances of churches apologizing for historical wrongs and proposed a theological framework for understanding this relatively new practice. His current research project is a critical examination of the claim that Christian martyrdom advances the unity of otherwise divided churches.

Research Interests My lab uses diverse methods to study theoretical models that help to explain the variation in well-being and psychopathology we see both across people and within a given person over time. The theory behind compassion-focused therapy (see Gilbert, 2005) has inspired a great deal of our research. In particular, we study the ways in which shame and self-criticism contribute to the development and maintenance of psychopathology, and compassion from others, for others, and for self contribute to its prevention and alleviation. My lab is primarily focused on testing the applicability of compassion-focused therapy, and its underlying theoretical model, to people with eating disorders and body image difficulties. We also study interventions designed help people become more self-compassionate and compassionate with others. My specific interrelated research interests include: The roles of shame, self-criticism, and self-compassion in the development, maintenance, and remission of psychopathology, especially eating disorders; Interventions and therapist behaviours that can reduce shame and self-criticism, and increase self-compassion; Fears of self-compassion and outward compassion, and how best to target these barriers in people with eating disorders; and The social contexts that facilitate versus undermine self-compassion, compassion for others, healthy body image, and intuitive eating.

Research Interests My lab uses diverse methods to study theoretical models that help to explain the variation in well-being and psychopathology we see both across people and within a given person over time. The theory behind compassion-focused therapy (see Gilbert, 2005) has inspired a great deal of our research. In particular, we study the ways in which shame and self-criticism contribute to the development and maintenance of psychopathology, and compassion from others, for others, and for self contribute to its prevention and alleviation. My lab is primarily focused on testing the applicability of compassion-focused therapy, and its underlying theoretical model, to people with eating disorders and body image difficulties. We also study interventions designed help people become more self-compassionate and compassionate with others. My specific interrelated research interests include: The roles of shame, self-criticism, and self-compassion in the development, maintenance, and remission of psychopathology, especially eating disorders; Interventions and therapist behaviours that can reduce shame and self-criticism, and increase self-compassion; Fears of self-compassion and outward compassion, and how best to target these barriers in people with eating disorders; and The social contexts that facilitate versus undermine self-compassion, compassion for others, healthy body image, and intuitive eating.

Initially, my work was in the area of verbal learning and memory, with emphasis on long-term memory structure and process, and especially in intentional forgetting, a topic which I have continued to study. Subsequently, I also became interested in individual differences in cognition, highlighting how people differ in their linguistic and spatial skills and strategies. Some of this work revolved around basic processes involved in reading. These domains then led me to a continuing interest in the area of attention. Primarily, this research has concerned the development of skill (automaticity) through learning/practice, particularly using the Stroop colour-word interference measure as a model task. More recently, my memory research has emphasized the role of consciousness in memory and the distinction between indirect tests of memory (implicit measures that do not require conscious awareness) and direct tests of memory (explicit measures that do require conscious awareness). Most recently, my lab has been exploring the production effect\u2014that having said things out loud helps in remembering them\u2014and contingency learning\u2014developing implicit associations between relevant and irrelevant information.

Initially, my work was in the area of verbal learning and memory, with emphasis on long-term memory structure and process, and especially in intentional forgetting, a topic which I have continued to study. Subsequently, I also became interested in individual differences in cognition, highlighting how people differ in their linguistic and spatial skills and strategies. Some of this work revolved around basic processes involved in reading. These domains then led me to a continuing interest in the area of attention. Primarily, this research has concerned the development of skill (automaticity) through learning/practice, particularly using the Stroop colour-word interference measure as a model task. More recently, my memory research has emphasized the role of consciousness in memory and the distinction between indirect tests of memory (implicit measures that do not require conscious awareness) and direct tests of memory (explicit measures that do require conscious awareness). Most recently, my lab has been exploring the production effect\u2014that having said things out loud helps in remembering them\u2014and contingency learning\u2014developing implicit associations between relevant and irrelevant information. I continue to be fascinated by the interplay between attention and memory, and the role that learning plays in that interaction.

Initially, my work was in the area of verbal learning and memory, with emphasis on long-term memory structure and process, and especially in intentional forgetting, a topic which I have continued to study. Subsequently, I also became interested in individual differences in cognition, highlighting how people differ in their linguistic and spatial skills and strategies. Some of this work revolved around basic processes involved in reading. These domains then led me to a continuing interest in the area of attention. Primarily, this research has concerned the development of skill (automaticity) through learning/practice, particularly using the Stroop colour-word interference measure as a model task. More recently, my memory research has emphasized the role of consciousness in memory and the distinction between indirect tests of memory (implicit measures that do not require conscious awareness) and direct tests of memory (explicit measures that do require conscious awareness). Most recently, my lab has been exploring the production effect\u2014that having said things out loud helps in remembering them\u2014and contingency learning\u2014developing implicit associations between relevant and irrelevant information. I continue to be fascinated by the interplay between attention and memory, and the role that learning plays in that interaction. \n\u2014\n\u2014\nthat having said things out loud helps in remembering them\n Selected publications (last 5 years)\n (Note: These and all other publications are available for download as PDFs from my lab website; see the link above.) \n (Note: These and all other publications are available for download as PDFs from my lab website; see the link above.)\n MacLeod, C.

Specific foci include: (1) modelling executive control across development, with a particular focus on transitional periods that occur in early childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, (2) identifying factors that influence the development of executive control, including neurobiological risk, psychosocial adversity, and social-cultural context, (3) further elucidating the relationship between executive control and other domains of function, including academic achievement, emotional adjustment, and peer relations, and (4) developing interventions that strengthen core executive skills.

My goal as a clinician scientist is to cultivate a programme of research in which the promotion of these skills is an overarching theme. Specific foci include: (1) modelling executive control across development, with a particular focus on transitional periods that occur in early childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, (2) identifying factors that influence the development of executive control, including neurobiological risk, psychosocial adversity, and social-cultural context, (3) further elucidating the relationship between executive control and other domains of function, including academic achievement, emotional adjustment, and peer relations, and (4) developing interventions that strengthen core executive skills.

I am interested in how social anxiety affects people\u2019s psychological, behavioural, neurocognitive, and emotional responses to social stress and reward within interpersonal contexts, with an emphasis on the role of autobiographical memory processes. My work is guided by clinical models of social anxiety disorder and focuses on the development of effective psychological interventions that target core mechanisms. Current research questions include: How do socially anxious individuals view and appraise themselves and others? What are the effects of such appraisals on social information processing, perceptions of social threat and reward, emotion regulation, interpersonal behaviour, relationship formation, mental images and memories, and psychotherapeutic process and outcome? How should we conceptualize the core psychological problems in social anxiety? How should we understand individual differences in social anxiety symptom expression and treatment response? How can we apply our conceptualizations most effectively to improve treatments for people with social anxiety disorder? How can neurocognitive models of learning and memory help to improve our understanding of self-schema development, maintenance, and updating in social anxiety disorder?

Lab research has been generously funded by the Canada Research Chairs Program, the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the National Medical Research Council of Australia, the Israel Science Foundation, the Templeton Foundation, the Ontario Mental Health Foundation, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, and the Ontario Research Fund. The physical space of the lab is generous and includes an array of specialized facilities, resources, and work spaces that can be accessed by trainees engaged in research at all levels. Students are supported in their acquisition of fundamental knowledge and technical skills within a stimulating and collaborative learning environment.\nTeaching\nAt the undergraduate level, I teach Psychopathology (Psych 257), which provides an introductory overview to the field of abnormal psychology. At the graduate level, I have most recently taught Adult Psychopathology (Psych 716), Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (Psych 725), and Ethics, Diversity, and Professional Issues in Clinical Psychology (Psych 719).\nAt the undergraduate level, I teach Psychopathology (Psych 257), which provides an introductory overview to the field of abnormal psychology.

In most (if not all) social contexts, this ability depends on an individual\u2019s ability to recognize and appreciate their conversational partner\u2019s perspective and modify their behaviours accordingly. While such sensitivity and flexibility may come easily for some people, for others it may create a challenge, resulting in less skills socio-communicative behaviour. Indeed, disrupted socio-communicative behaviour can be the most debilitating aspect of many pediatric mental health conditions. In my lab (CDL), my students and I examine how children, adolescents, and adults successfully navigate communicative interactions with others. Our work has relevance for identifying who may be at risk for communicative challenges and what may be the best way to support youth in their socio-communicative development. While most of our research projects fall under the general theme of communication, there are various streams: How well do children, adolescents, and adults\u2019 use the perspective of their conversational partner to guide behaviour? Historically, children have been seen as \u2018egocentric\u2019 or insensitive to other\u2019s mental states. However, remarkable sensitivity has been demonstrated in many different contexts. We look at when this sensitivity to others\u2019 perspective is (or is not) demonstrated. To what extent do adolescents think about the mental states (thoughts/feelings) of online communicative partners? Over the last decade, the communicative context for youth has changed dramatically with an increase in online communication. We look at how adolescents communicate online, and what characteristics affect what they say/post and how they interpret others\u2019 communication. What cognitive skills support youths\u2019 communicative success? Given that at a young age children can appreciate the perspective of a partner, what other skills support their ability to use this information during different interactions? How does an individual\u2019s temperament relate to their communicative abilities? Children (and adults) with temperaments that are more shy or anxious tend to withdraw from (new) social situations. We look at how perceptions of social partners and/or of communicative utterances may differ according to temperamental style. What cognitive skills are associated with a child\u2019s ability to navigate diverse social situations (e.g., collaborating, sharing, recognizing inequity)? Uncovering the nature and development of such prosocial behaviour is important given its strong relations to children\u2019s later social and academic success. How can we understand the communicative challenges associated with various conditions, such as ADHD? Though not always the case, many individuals with ADHD (children and adults) struggle in the interpersonal domain. In this line of work, we seek to determine why this may be the case. I strive to create an inclusive research environment, where all students feel that they have agency and voice as they pursue their graduate training. Research projects are collaboratively developed, and we use research team meetings as an opportunity to share/discuss ideas with other researchers in the Cognitive Development Lab. Students are encouraged to present their work to academic and non-academic audiences. In addition to collaborating with researchers from Psychology, students in the lab may have opportunities to work with interdisciplinary collaborators. For instance, with collaborators in Computer Science, we are currently looking at how children teach social robots (and learn through this process). Beyond research activities, I value the opportunity to support students in pursuing endeavours that build their professional skills more generally, tailored to their own specific career aspirations. I am registered with the College of Psychologists of Ontario and am involved in the clinical supervision of graduate students in our UW Centre for Mental Health Research and Treatment (CMHRT). At the CMHRT, I supervise therapeutic interventions with children, adolescents, and adults.

Our work has relevance for identifying who may be at risk for communicative challenges and what may be the best way to support youth in their socio-communicative development.

Though not always the case, many individuals with ADHD (children and adults) struggle in the interpersonal domain. In this line of work, we seek to determine why this may be the case. I strive to create an inclusive research environment, where all students feel that they have agency and voice as they pursue their graduate training. Research projects are collaboratively developed, and we use research team meetings as an opportunity to share/discuss ideas with other researchers in the Cognitive Development Lab. Students are encouraged to present their work to academic and non-academic audiences. In addition to collaborating with researchers from Psychology, students in the lab may have opportunities to work with interdisciplinary collaborators. For instance, with collaborators in Computer Science, we are currently looking at how children teach social robots (and learn through this process). Beyond research activities, I value the opportunity to support students in pursuing endeavours that build their professional skills more generally, tailored to their own specific career aspirations. I am registered with the College of Psychologists of Ontario and am involved in the clinical supervision of graduate students in our UW Centre for Mental Health Research and Treatment (CMHRT).

Historically, children have been seen as \u2018egocentric\u2019 or insensitive to other\u2019s mental states. However, remarkable sensitivity has been demonstrated in many different contexts. We look at when this sensitivity to others\u2019 perspective is (or is not) demonstrated. To what extent do adolescents think about the mental states (thoughts/feelings) of online communicative partners? Over the last decade, the communicative context for youth has changed dramatically with an increase in online communication. We look at how adolescents communicate online, and what characteristics affect what they say/post and how they interpret others\u2019 communication. What cognitive skills support youths\u2019 communicative success? Given that at a young age children can appreciate the perspective of a partner, what other skills support their ability to use this information during different interactions? How does an individual\u2019s temperament relate to their communicative abilities? Children (and adults) with temperaments that are more shy or anxious tend to withdraw from (new) social situations. We look at how perceptions of social partners and/or of communicative utterances may differ according to temperamental style. What cognitive skills are associated with a child\u2019s ability to navigate diverse social situations (e.g., collaborating, sharing, recognizing inequity)? Uncovering the nature and development of such prosocial behaviour is important given its strong relations to children\u2019s later social and academic success.

Research projects are collaboratively developed, and we use research team meetings as an opportunity to share/discuss ideas with other researchers in the Cognitive Development Lab. Students are encouraged to present their work to academic and non-academic audiences. In addition to collaborating with researchers from Psychology, students in the lab may have opportunities to work with interdisciplinary collaborators. For instance, with collaborators in Computer Science, we are currently looking at how children teach social robots (and learn through this process). Beyond research activities, I value the opportunity to support students in pursuing endeavours that build their professional skills more generally, tailored to their own specific career aspirations. I am registered with the College of Psychologists of Ontario and am involved in the clinical supervision of graduate students in our UW Centre for Mental Health Research and Treatment (CMHRT). At the CMHRT, I supervise therapeutic interventions with children, adolescents, and adults. My clinical work is guided by empirically supported methods, with my primary theoretical orientation as cognitive behavioural. Selected publications Please see lab website for list of publications.

My studies examine these developments in communication in a broad sense, and include the study of children's gestures as well as spoken language; the study of children's communication in naturalistic as well as laboratory settings; and the study of children's communicative abilities in many forms such as everyday talk with parents and siblings, peer-to-peer conversation, story telling and story comprehension. My research has also led to the development of the Language Use Inventory (LUI), a standardized parent-report measure assessing pragmatic language development in children 18 to 47 months of age, now used internationally by speech-language professionals and researchers.

She applies findings from research on spoken interaction to language teaching/learning contexts, to inform the teaching and testing of interactional competence in second-language classrooms and to guide language teacher training. \nBiography\nDr. Betz joined the University of Waterloo in 2012.

I also think that this desire to escape was fundamentally a protest against heteronormativity, though I didn\u2019t know it at the time. After receiving my Ph.D. at Princeton University, working on H\u00f6lderlin and Novalis, I took a position at the University of North Carolina, where I worked 25 years, first in German and then jointly in Comparative Literature. After receiving tenure, I ventured further afield in my research and published an article on E.T.A. Hoffmann\u2019s story, \u201cThe Sandman\u201d and David Lynch\u2019s Blue Velvet. It started an exploration into ever new areas of research, a pattern that has characterized my entire academic life as a dilettante. Working more on film (co-mingled with queer theory), I published The Queer German Cinema in 2000. It was preceded in 1996 by an another major publication\u2014the first on queer issues in 18th-century literature and on the topic of what I like to term \u201chomoaesthetics\u201d\u2014Outing Goethe and His Age, a volume that I edited. Pursuing my passions further (I am the owner of two lovely whippets) I started working in the area of animal studies and came out in 2006 with Melancholia\u2019s Dog: Reflections on Our Animal Kinship. Along the way, I have had guest professorships teaching a semester each at Princeton University, Rutgers University, and the University of Minnesota. I moved back to Canada in 2008 to escape Bush\u2019s regime and assumed a position at uWaterloo in the Department of Germanic and Slavic Studies. Here I helped to set up the Fine Arts major in Visual Culture and every fall teach a large first-year film class on contemporary Global Cinema. I lead a research group on \u201cPoetics and Nature circa 1800\u201d for the Waterloo Centre for German Studies. As an amateur herbalist I became interested in homeopathy and started researching its origins in German Romantic medicine, life sciences, and philosophy. The result is a just published book, with a nod to Nietzsche, entitled The Birth of Homeopathy out of the Spirit of Romanticism. I currently hold a University Research Chair.

Around 1800 scientists, philosophers, and poets alike believed in a life force uniting all of nature. In response to the eighteenth-century classification of species and mechanistic view of nature, the Romantics envisaged a dynamic harmonic symbiosis with nature. Although homeopathy has enjoyed a vibrant afterlife up to our present day, its intellectual, indeed poetic, groundings have been largely forgotten. I investigate how authors as Goethe and Novalis underscore the importance of the literary field in this momentous chapter to the history of science and medicine. As an outgrowth of this research, I also investigate how the homeopathic anamnesis and repertoires influence the poetry of the main female author of 19th-century Germany, Annette von Droste-H\u00fclshoff, who consulted a homeopath for over a decade.

This first project was followed by two more SSHRC-funded projects with Jennifer Dailey-O'Cain: \"German identity in urban Canada: A qualitative and quantitative study of language and discourse\" (2007-2012) and \u201cIdeologies of English in the linguistic landscape\u201d (2021-2024). Several grants through U Waterloo\u2019s Learning Innovation and Teaching Enhancement fund allowed me to do teaching and learning-related research, including the use of archival sources from U Waterloo\u2019s Porter library (Sommer Fonds) as transcultural experiential learning components. The creation of the \"Social Interaction, Language and Culture Laboratory\" (SILC lab), supported by the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)/Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation (ORI), will allow further research into multilingualism and identity. Alongside my research and teaching, I have held several administrative positions, including Associate Chair, Undergraduate Studies and Chair of Germanic and Slavic Studies, as well as Acting and Interim Chair of Communication Arts at U of Waterloo. I am proud to have received U Waterloo\u2019s Outstanding Performance Award twice (2013, 2023).

My research interests lie in the area of language education and include topics such as language and gender, language and culture, autonomy, drama pedagogy, multilingualism, the educational value of inflatable toys in the language classroom, teacher cognition, etc.\n Teaching interests Applied linguistics, German language Recent courses: GER 420/615/715: Topics in Language Education: Grammatikunterricht APPLS 301: Language and Culture CI 100: Cultural Identities Today GER 101, 102, 201 GER 603/RUSS 603: Language Didactics GER 614: Power/Language GER 614: Gender and Language GER 615: Philosophies of Language Education GER 615/715: Michel Foucault's Impact on Applied Linguistics ENGL 720/GER 615/715: The 'Native Speaker' in Language Education Research interests Applied linguistics (foreign language education, gender studies, and cultural theory) Selected research: Das Native-Speaker-Konstrukt im Fokus.

Wealth Management Course (AFM 324) \u00b7 Steve created a brand new Wealth Management course using a revolutionary Problem Based Learning (PBL) model that was adopted from the original PBL medical school model.

Since then, Steve has conducted workshops and presentations to teach institutions and individuals the new PBL model for finance. International Study Course (AFM 415) \u00b7 Steve created a brand new international course which has brought students to London (to understand the inner workings of Brexit), to Hong Kong (to understand the inner workings of Belt and Road initiative in China), as well as Germany (to understand the inner workings of the biggest country in the EU).

In an effort to educate his students and the general public about private equity, Steve launched a one-of-a-kind Private Equity YouTube Channel to make the complex world of private equity simple. This channel has received over 250,000 views and counting: Steve Balaban - Private Equity YouTube Channel. He is an inspiring, entertaining speaker on the subjects of private equity, wealth management and entrepreneurship.

I returned to academia and developed a professional interest in 20th and 21st century French Literature during my Master at the University of Waterloo French Studies Department where I completed a thesis entitled : \u201cWriting on the Body and Violence: Study of Selected Texts from Am\u00e9lie Nothomb and Sylvie Germain\u201d. After completing this degree, I headed to the University of Toronto and successfully finished a PhD dissertation on the inscription of trauma in female autobiographical narratives in France since 1980. I explored the textual inscription of childhood trauma in the works of six contemporary French authors and analyzed how each author articulated the traumatic scene within the context of the narrative and which textual strategies were used to convey the obsessive memory of a private childhood traumas such as incest, mistreatment or the loss of parents. Research and teaching interests 20th and 21st French and Francophone literature Literature and Arts Novels, Plays, Autobiographical/Autofictional Writing Trauma studies / Genocide Intergenerational/Transgenerational Transmission Psychoanalytic theories Postcolonial theories Feminist theories Comic and Graphic Novels Current projects I specialize in 20th/21st French and Francophone Literature at the French Studies Department where I am active in both the undergraduate and graduate programs. My research focuses on the field of contemporary autobiographical/autofictional narratives, particularly those related to personal and collective traumas. I am also interested in the narratives of illness and intergenerational and transgenerational transmission in literature. While maintaining my interest in the representation of trauma in literature, I am expanding the scope of my research to include the notion of collective trauma, as expressed, for example, by the author Scholastique Mukasonga, who writes about the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda. In working on Mukasonga\u2019s text, I decided to focus on the plight of children in situations of armed conflict and urban violence, more particularly in the literature of sub-Saharan French Africa. The specific focus of this project will be narratives that represent the lived reality of marginalized African youth who are exploited and victimized by forces outside the law. In the literature of sub-Saharan French African novels that I propose to study, the child is depicted as an observer, a victim, and sometimes an actor. Despite the range of political and social contexts and the different traumas experienced, it becomes clear in these texts that the child occupies a specific semiotic position in testifying to the cultural and moral crisis of post-colonial Africa.

Research and teaching interests 20th and 21st French and Francophone literature Literature and Arts Novels, Plays, Autobiographical/Autofictional Writing Trauma studies / Genocide Intergenerational/Transgenerational Transmission Psychoanalytic theories Postcolonial theories Feminist theories Comic and Graphic Novels Current projects I specialize in 20th/21st French and Francophone Literature at the French Studies Department where I am active in both the undergraduate and graduate programs. My research focuses on the field of contemporary autobiographical/autofictional narratives, particularly those related to personal and collective traumas. I am also interested in the narratives of illness and intergenerational and transgenerational transmission in literature. While maintaining my interest in the representation of trauma in literature, I am expanding the scope of my research to include the notion of collective trauma, as expressed, for example, by the author Scholastique Mukasonga, who writes about the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda. In working on Mukasonga\u2019s text, I decided to focus on the plight of children in situations of armed conflict and urban violence, more particularly in the literature of sub-Saharan French Africa. The specific focus of this project will be narratives that represent the lived reality of marginalized African youth who are exploited and victimized by forces outside the law. In the literature of sub-Saharan French African novels that I propose to study, the child is depicted as an observer, a victim, and sometimes an actor. Despite the range of political and social contexts and the different traumas experienced, it becomes clear in these texts that the child occupies a specific semiotic position in testifying to the cultural and moral crisis of post-colonial Africa.

Research and teaching interests 20th and 21st French and Francophone literature Literature and Arts Novels, Plays, Autobiographical/Autofictional Writing Trauma studies / Genocide Intergenerational/Transgenerational Transmission Psychoanalytic theories Postcolonial theories Feminist theories Comic and Graphic Novels Current projects I specialize in 20th/21st French and Francophone Literature at the French Studies Department where I am active in both the undergraduate and graduate programs. My research focuses on the field of contemporary autobiographical/autofictional narratives, particularly those related to personal and collective traumas. I am also interested in the narratives of illness and intergenerational and transgenerational transmission in literature. While maintaining my interest in the representation of trauma in literature, I am expanding the scope of my research to include the notion of collective trauma, as expressed, for example, by the author Scholastique Mukasonga, who writes about the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda. In working on Mukasonga\u2019s text, I decided to focus on the plight of children in situations of armed conflict and urban violence, more particularly in the literature of sub-Saharan French Africa. The specific focus of this project will be narratives that represent the lived reality of marginalized African youth who are exploited and victimized by forces outside the law. In the literature of sub-Saharan French African novels that I propose to study, the child is depicted as an observer, a victim, and sometimes an actor. Despite the range of political and social contexts and the different traumas experienced, it becomes clear in these texts that the child occupies a specific semiotic position in testifying to the cultural and moral crisis of post-colonial Africa.

I returned to academia and developed a professional interest in 20th and 21st century French Literature during my Master at the University of Waterloo French Studies Department where I completed a thesis entitled : \u201cWriting on the Body and Violence: Study of Selected Texts from Am\u00e9lie Nothomb and Sylvie Germain\u201d. After completing this degree, I headed to the University of Toronto and successfully finished a PhD dissertation on the inscription of trauma in female autobiographical narratives in France since 1980. I explored the textual inscription of childhood trauma in the works of six contemporary French authors and analyzed how each author articulated the traumatic scene within the context of the narrative and which textual strategies were used to convey the obsessive memory of a private childhood traumas such as incest, mistreatment or the loss of parents. \nth\nst\n Research and teaching interests\n Research and teaching interests\n 20th and 21st French and Francophone literature Literature and Arts Novels, Plays, Autobiographical/Autofictional Writing Trauma studies / Genocide Intergenerational/Transgenerational Transmission Psychoanalytic theories Postcolonial theories Feminist theories Comic and Graphic Novels \n 20th and 21st French and Francophone literature \nth\nst\n Literature and Arts \n Novels, Plays, Autobiographical/Autofictional Writing \n Trauma studies / Genocide \n Intergenerational/Transgenerational Transmission \n Psychoanalytic theories \n Postcolonial theories \n Feminist theories \n Comic and Graphic Novels \n Current projects\n Current projects\n I specialize in 20th/21st French and Francophone Literature at the French Studies Department where I am active in both the undergraduate and graduate programs. My research focuses on the field of contemporary autobiographical/autofictional narratives, particularly those related to personal and collective traumas. I am also interested in the narratives of illness and intergenerational and transgenerational transmission in literature. While maintaining my interest in the representation of trauma in literature, I am expanding the scope of my research to include the notion of collective trauma, as expressed, for example, by the author Scholastique Mukasonga, who writes about the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda. In working on Mukasonga\u2019s text, I decided to focus on the plight of children in situations of armed conflict and urban violence, more particularly in the literature of sub-Saharan French Africa. The specific focus of this project will be narratives that represent the lived reality of marginalized African youth who are exploited and victimized by forces outside the law. In the literature of sub-Saharan French African novels that I propose to study, the child is depicted as an observer, a victim, and sometimes an actor. Despite the range of political and social contexts and the different traumas experienced, it becomes clear in these texts that the child occupies a specific semiotic position in testifying to the cultural and moral crisis of post-colonial Africa. \n Selected publications\n Selected publications\n Books\n \u00c9crire les blessures de l\u2019enfance.

I mostly work on how crime is fictionalized in 19th-century novels and on the development of newspapers fiction (roman-feuilleton). After studying urban mysteries in my doctoral thesis, I now focus my research on how popular culture gives us insights on the anxieties and the fascination created by modernity.

My work aims to shed light on the ways literary works \u2013 often from forgotten authors \u2013 integrate the modern city and the mass media. I study how these new realities, effective or fantasized, involve new ways to publish, new publics to conquer, and efforts to reinvent well-known themes. My recent projects are focused on the strategies deployed in these literary works to seduce the reader by transforming old literary processes in order to create new effects, a technique still relevant in popular culture today. I am also currently principal investigator on a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Grant developing an online database of newspaper fiction in France between 1836 and 1881. This project intends to organize the unknown continent constituted by roman-feuilleton and aims at providing a more accurate perception of 19th-century novel by going beyond the authors always remembered by literary history books. The database is called Le Rez-de-chauss\u00e9e; it can be accessed here: http://rezdechaussee.uwaterloo.ca/. Projets en cours Mes projets de recherche actuels sont organis\u00e9s autour de deux enjeux intimement li\u00e9s : les repr\u00e9sentations litt\u00e9raires de la criminalit\u00e9 urbaine et l\u2019\u00e9mergence du roman-feuilleton. Mes travaux ont pour objectif d\u2019\u00e9clairer les mani\u00e8res dont des \u0153uvres litt\u00e9raires \u2013 souvent propos\u00e9es par des \u00e9crivains oubli\u00e9s \u2013 int\u00e8grent la ville moderne et le d\u00e9veloppement de la grande presse. J\u2019\u00e9tudie comment ces enjeux, bien r\u00e9els mais aussi en partie fantasm\u00e9s, impliquent de nouveaux moyens de publier, de nouveaux publics \u00e0 conqu\u00e9rir et un effort soutenu pour r\u00e9inventer et r\u00e9actualiser des th\u00e8mes et des sc\u00e9narios bien connus. Plus r\u00e9cemment, je me suis concentr\u00e9 sur les strat\u00e9gies d\u00e9ploy\u00e9es dans de telles \u0153uvres pour s\u00e9duire le lecteur en transformant des m\u00e9canismes convenus pour cr\u00e9er des effets neufs, une approche toujours pertinente dans les cultures populaires d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui.

at Minsk State Linguistic University (Belarus), studying languages and their structure. In Canada, I pursued my passion for study of intonation and French dialects. My PhD research dealt with intonational differences between Canadian French (Quebec City region) and European French (Troyes region) in spontaneous speech. Using the normalization procedure, which allowed me to compare voices of different qualities, I particularly studied the realization of a rising contour and found dialectal markers that create surface prosodic variation in the two dialects. My current research interest is French in contact. I study learners\u2019 French and French spoken in Ontario in a minority setting (Windsor region). I am most intrigued by prosody and examine social and stylistic variation of various aspects of rhythm and intonation. These analyses also include a comparison with dialects of French spoken in majority settings in Ontario, Quebec and France. One of the main goals of this research agenda is to add to descriptions of the prosody of Canadian French dialects and of French as a second language.

In Canada, I pursued my passion for study of intonation and French dialects. My PhD research dealt with intonational differences between Canadian French (Quebec City region) and European French (Troyes region) in spontaneous speech. Using the normalization procedure, which allowed me to compare voices of different qualities, I particularly studied the realization of a rising contour and found dialectal markers that create surface prosodic variation in the two dialects. My current research interest is French in contact. I study learners\u2019 French and French spoken in Ontario in a minority setting (Windsor region). I am most intrigued by prosody and examine social and stylistic variation of various aspects of rhythm and intonation. These analyses also include a comparison with dialects of French spoken in majority settings in Ontario, Quebec and France. One of the main goals of this research agenda is to add to descriptions of the prosody of Canadian French dialects and of French as a second language.

In Canada, I pursued my passion for study of intonation and French dialects. My PhD research dealt with intonational differences between Canadian French (Quebec City region) and European French (Troyes region) in spontaneous speech. Using the normalization procedure, which allowed me to compare voices of different qualities, I particularly studied the realization of a rising contour and found dialectal markers that create surface prosodic variation in the two dialects. My current research interest is French in contact. I study learners\u2019 French and French spoken in Ontario in a minority setting (Windsor region). I am most intrigued by prosody and examine social and stylistic variation of various aspects of rhythm and intonation. These analyses also include a comparison with dialects of French spoken in majority settings in Ontario, Quebec and France. One of the main goals of this research agenda is to add to descriptions of the prosody of Canadian French dialects and of French as a second language.

In Canada, I pursued my passion for study of intonation and French dialects. My PhD research dealt with intonational differences between Canadian French (Quebec City region) and European French (Troyes region) in spontaneous speech. Using the normalization procedure, which allowed me to compare voices of different qualities, I particularly studied the realization of a rising contour and found dialectal markers that create surface prosodic variation in the two dialects. \nI completed my undergraduate studies at Minsk State Linguistic University (Belarus), studying languages and their structure.

I study learners\u2019 French and French spoken in Ontario in a minority setting (Windsor region). I am most intrigued by prosody and examine social and stylistic variation of various aspects of rhythm and intonation. These analyses also include a comparison with dialects of French spoken in majority settings in Ontario, Quebec and France. One of the main goals of this research agenda is to add to descriptions of the prosody of Canadian French dialects and of French as a second language. \nMy current research interest is French in contact.

I grew up in the beautiful French Alps where I completed my undergraduate studies and undertook my first research project in comparative literature. Initially, I came to Canada as an exchange student at Queen\u2019s University (Kingston, Ontario). Through this experience, I discovered Qu\u00e9bec literature and developed a passion for it. I returned to France, in Lyon this time, to undertake a Master thesis on the construction of identity and otherness in marginal areas, the settings of most of Louis Hamelin\u2019s early novels. I then moved to Vancouver to complete a PhD in contemporary Qu\u00e9bec literature. My doctoral thesis addressed questions more broadly linked to the representation of marginal sites in novels, poems, and essays by the authors Pierre Morency, Pierre Nepveu, and Louis Hamelin. My first position as Assistant Professor was at Universit\u00e9 Saint-Boniface, in the French community of Winnipeg. Over the course of this one-year position, my interest for the francophone minorities in Canada started to translate in research publications. I came to the University of Waterloo as a Lecturer in 2010 and was appointed as a Faculty member in 2011. My teaching and research focuses mainly on the two fields of Qu\u00e9bec and francophone minorities studies. Some of the key concepts that I reflect on are the transformation of landscapes, regional dynamics, conservation and sustainability, tourism, migrations, memory, and power relations imposed on various minorities or marginalized groups. I am also actively involved as a professional and community member by volunteering and holding positions on executive boards and associations. Last but not least, I am the proud mother of three children. Biographie Mon int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les lieux, les paysages et les distances est li\u00e9 aux divers endroits o\u00f9 j\u2019ai v\u00e9cu. J\u2019ai grandi dans les magnifiques Alpes fran\u00e7aises, o\u00f9 j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 mes \u00e9tudes. Mon premier projet de recherche \u00e9tait en litt\u00e9rature compar\u00e9e. Je suis initialement venue au Canada pour la premi\u00e8re fois en tant qu\u2019\u00e9tudiante d\u2019\u00e9change \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Queen\u2019s (Kingston, Ontario). C\u2019est au cours de cette exp\u00e9rience que j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert la litt\u00e9rature qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise qui m\u2019a tout de suite passionn\u00e9e. Je suis retourn\u00e9e en France, \u00e0 Lyon cette fois-ci, pour entreprendre une th\u00e8se de ma\u00eetrise (Master 2) sur la construction de l\u2019identit\u00e9 et de l\u2019alt\u00e9rit\u00e9 dans les espaces marginaux o\u00f9 Louis Hamelin situe la plupart des intrigues de ses premiers romans. J\u2019ai ensuite d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9aliser ma th\u00e8se de doctorat en litt\u00e9rature qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise contemporaine, \u00e9tudiant plus largement les repr\u00e9sentations des espaces marginaux dans les romans, les po\u00e8mes et les essais des auteurs Pierre Morency, Pierre Nepveu et Louis Hamelin. Mon premier poste comme professeure adjointe \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Saint-Boniface, dans la communaut\u00e9 francophone de Winnipeg. Au cours de cette ann\u00e9e au Manitoba, mon int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les minorit\u00e9s francophones du Canada a alors commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se traduire en publications de recherche. Je suis d\u2019abord arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Waterloo comme lectrice en 2010, puis ai acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de professeure en 2011. Je poursuis mes recherches dans ces deux champs, des \u00e9tudes qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises et des minorit\u00e9s francophones. Quelques-uns des concepts cl\u00e9s qui nourrissent ma r\u00e9flexion sont la transformation des paysages, la dynamique des r\u00e9gions, la pr\u00e9servation et la durabilit\u00e9, le tourisme, les migrations, la m\u00e9moire et les dynamiques de pouvoir impos\u00e9es \u00e0 diverses minorit\u00e9s ou \u00e0 des groupes marginalis\u00e9s. Par ailleurs, je suis aussi une membre active sur les plans professionnel et communautaire : je fais du b\u00e9n\u00e9volat, suis membre de plusieurs associations et membre de comit\u00e9s ex\u00e9cutifs. Enfin et surtout, je suis la maman combl\u00e9e de trois enfants.

The \u201cpoetry from the land\u201d in the 1950s and 1960s was centered on the political concepts of land and country. Some of the most famous poems of that time represented Qu\u00e9bec land in a very lyrical and abstract manner through decontextualized natural elements. My observation of contemporary creation since the 2000\u2019s unveils what is both a return to the representation of non-urbanized areas \u2013 that I theorized in my first book -, and a change of perspective. To me, one of the dominant traits of current Qu\u00e9bec poetry lies in its realism and its close attention to aesthetics, whereby emphasis is no longer on the land, but its landscapes. My objective consists in illustrating this shift from the politics of the land to the aesthetic landscape. I analyze the concept of landscape at the intersection of the theories of geopoetics and ecopoetics. Indeed, the landscape is not the mere representation of a place but constitutes a complex living environment intertwined with relationships. Thus, this project tackles wider issues such as the transformation of our post-industrial environments, conservation and sustainability of unique landscapes, the impacts of tourism and migrations on communities and ecosystems, the division of resources and representations between (political, demographic, and economical) centres and marginalized regions. Within the framework of this project, I conduct interviews with authors and artists.

La po\u00e9sie du pays des ann\u00e9es 1950 et 1960 \u00e9tait centr\u00e9e sur le concept politique de pays, qu\u2019elle \u00e9voquait de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 la fois lyrique et d\u00e9sincarn\u00e9e \u00e0 travers des \u00e9l\u00e9ments naturels souvent isol\u00e9s, d\u00e9contextualis\u00e9s. Depuis 2000, j\u2019observe dans la cr\u00e9ation contemporaine ce qui est \u00e0 la fois un retour \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation d\u2019espaces non urbanis\u00e9s \u2013 que je d\u00e9signais par le terme de \u00ab confins \u00bb dans mon premier livre \u2013, et un changement de perspective. Ce qui me para\u00eet dominer au sein de toute une portion de la po\u00e9sie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise actuelle est son r\u00e9alisme et son attention \u00e0 l\u2019esth\u00e9tique, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire non plus au pays, mais \u00e0 ses paysages. Mon objectif consiste donc \u00e0 illustrer ce d\u00e9placement du pays politique au paysage esth\u00e9tique. J\u2019\u00e9tudie le concept de paysage en croisant les th\u00e9ories de la g\u00e9opo\u00e9tique et de l\u2019\u00e9copo\u00e9tique. En effet, le paysage n\u2019est pas seulement la repr\u00e9sentation d\u2019un lieu, mais constitue un milieu de vie complexe tiss\u00e9 de relations. Ce projet aborde donc de plus larges questions telles que la transformation de nos espaces de vie \u00e0 l\u2019heure postindustrielle, la pr\u00e9servation et la durabilit\u00e9 de paysages uniques, les impacts du tourisme et des migrations sur les communaut\u00e9s et les \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes, le partage des ressources et des repr\u00e9sentations entre les centres (politiques, d\u00e9mographiques et \u00e9conomiques) et les r\u00e9gions marginalis\u00e9s.

I grew up in the beautiful French Alps where I completed my undergraduate studies and undertook my first research project in comparative literature. Initially, I came to Canada as an exchange student at Queen\u2019s University (Kingston, Ontario). Through this experience, I discovered Qu\u00e9bec literature and developed a passion for it. I returned to France, in Lyon this time, to undertake a Master thesis on the construction of identity and otherness in marginal areas, the settings of most of Louis Hamelin\u2019s early novels. I then moved to Vancouver to complete a PhD in contemporary Qu\u00e9bec literature. My doctoral thesis addressed questions more broadly linked to the representation of marginal sites in novels, poems, and essays by the authors Pierre Morency, Pierre Nepveu, and Louis Hamelin. My first position as Assistant Professor was at Universit\u00e9 Saint-Boniface, in the French community of Winnipeg. Over the course of this one-year position, my interest for the francophone minorities in Canada started to translate in research publications. I came to the University of Waterloo as a Lecturer in 2010 and was appointed as a Faculty member in 2011. My teaching and research focuses mainly on the two fields of Qu\u00e9bec and francophone minorities studies. Some of the key concepts that I reflect on are the transformation of landscapes, regional dynamics, conservation and sustainability, tourism, migrations, memory, and power relations imposed on various minorities or marginalized groups. I am also actively involved as a professional and community member by volunteering and holding positions on executive boards and associations. Last but not least, I am the proud mother of three children. Biographie Mon int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les lieux, les paysages et les distances est li\u00e9 aux divers endroits o\u00f9 j\u2019ai v\u00e9cu. J\u2019ai grandi dans les magnifiques Alpes fran\u00e7aises, o\u00f9 j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 mes \u00e9tudes. Mon premier projet de recherche \u00e9tait en litt\u00e9rature compar\u00e9e. Je suis initialement venue au Canada pour la premi\u00e8re fois en tant qu\u2019\u00e9tudiante d\u2019\u00e9change \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Queen\u2019s (Kingston, Ontario). C\u2019est au cours de cette exp\u00e9rience que j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert la litt\u00e9rature qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise qui m\u2019a tout de suite passionn\u00e9e. Je suis retourn\u00e9e en France, \u00e0 Lyon cette fois-ci, pour entreprendre une th\u00e8se de ma\u00eetrise (Master 2) sur la construction de l\u2019identit\u00e9 et de l\u2019alt\u00e9rit\u00e9 dans les espaces marginaux o\u00f9 Louis Hamelin situe la plupart des intrigues de ses premiers romans. J\u2019ai ensuite d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9aliser ma th\u00e8se de doctorat en litt\u00e9rature qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise contemporaine, \u00e9tudiant plus largement les repr\u00e9sentations des espaces marginaux dans les romans, les po\u00e8mes et les essais des auteurs Pierre Morency, Pierre Nepveu et Louis Hamelin. Mon premier poste comme professeure adjointe \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Saint-Boniface, dans la communaut\u00e9 francophone de Winnipeg. Au cours de cette ann\u00e9e au Manitoba, mon int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les minorit\u00e9s francophones du Canada a alors commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se traduire en publications de recherche. Je suis d\u2019abord arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Waterloo comme lectrice en 2010, puis ai acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de professeure en 2011. Je poursuis mes recherches dans ces deux champs, des \u00e9tudes qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises et des minorit\u00e9s francophones. Quelques-uns des concepts cl\u00e9s qui nourrissent ma r\u00e9flexion sont la transformation des paysages, la dynamique des r\u00e9gions, la pr\u00e9servation et la durabilit\u00e9, le tourisme, les migrations, la m\u00e9moire et les dynamiques de pouvoir impos\u00e9es \u00e0 diverses minorit\u00e9s ou \u00e0 des groupes marginalis\u00e9s. Par ailleurs, je suis aussi une membre active sur les plans professionnel et communautaire : je fais du b\u00e9n\u00e9volat, suis membre de plusieurs associations et membre de comit\u00e9s ex\u00e9cutifs. Enfin et surtout, je suis la maman combl\u00e9e de trois enfants. Research and teaching interests Qu\u00e9bec literature and culture Poetry Geopoetics, theories of landscape Ecocriticism, ecofeminism Regionality, migrations, tourism, postindustrial places Literature and cultural studies of francophone minorities in Canada Theories of care and intersectionality; the dynamics of power on minorities or marginalized groups Literature and visual arts Domaines d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la recherche et l\u2019enseignement Litt\u00e9rature et culture qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises Po\u00e9sie G\u00e9opo\u00e9tique, th\u00e9ories du paysage \u00c9copo\u00e9tique, \u00e9cof\u00e9minisme R\u00e9gionalit\u00e9, migrations, tourisme et lieux postindustriels Litt\u00e9rature et \u00e9tudes culturelles des minorit\u00e9s de la francophonie canadienne Th\u00e9ories du care et de l\u2019intersectionnalit\u00e9; les dynamiques de pouvoir envers les minorit\u00e9s ou des groupes marginalis\u00e9s Litt\u00e9rature et arts visuels Current projects My current research project, entitled \u201cFrom Land to Landscape: Qu\u00e9bec poetry in perspective since 1950\u201d (SSRHC 2016-2019), examines the evolution of Qu\u00e9bec poetry. The \u201cpoetry from the land\u201d in the 1950s and 1960s was centered on the political concepts of land and country. Some of the most famous poems of that time represented Qu\u00e9bec land in a very lyrical and abstract manner through decontextualized natural elements. My observation of contemporary creation since the 2000\u2019s unveils what is both a return to the representation of non-urbanized areas \u2013 that I theorized in my first book -, and a change of perspective. To me, one of the dominant traits of current Qu\u00e9bec poetry lies in its realism and its close attention to aesthetics, whereby emphasis is no longer on the land, but its landscapes. My objective consists in illustrating this shift from the politics of the land to the aesthetic landscape. I analyze the concept of landscape at the intersection of the theories of geopoetics and ecopoetics. Indeed, the landscape is not the mere representation of a place but constitutes a complex living environment intertwined with relationships. Thus, this project tackles wider issues such as the transformation of our post-industrial environments, conservation and sustainability of unique landscapes, the impacts of tourism and migrations on communities and ecosystems, the division of resources and representations between (political, demographic, and economical) centres and marginalized regions. Within the framework of this project, I conduct interviews with authors and artists.

Mon premier poste comme professeure adjointe \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Saint-Boniface, dans la communaut\u00e9 francophone de Winnipeg. Au cours de cette ann\u00e9e au Manitoba, mon int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les minorit\u00e9s francophones du Canada a alors commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se traduire en publications de recherche. Je suis d\u2019abord arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Waterloo comme lectrice en 2010, puis ai acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de professeure en 2011. Je poursuis mes recherches dans ces deux champs, des \u00e9tudes qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises et des minorit\u00e9s francophones. Quelques-uns des concepts cl\u00e9s qui nourrissent ma r\u00e9flexion sont la transformation des paysages, la dynamique des r\u00e9gions, la pr\u00e9servation et la durabilit\u00e9, le tourisme, les migrations, la m\u00e9moire et les dynamiques de pouvoir impos\u00e9es \u00e0 diverses minorit\u00e9s ou \u00e0 des groupes marginalis\u00e9s. Par ailleurs, je suis aussi une membre active sur les plans professionnel et communautaire : je fais du b\u00e9n\u00e9volat, suis membre de plusieurs associations et membre de comit\u00e9s ex\u00e9cutifs. Enfin et surtout, je suis la maman combl\u00e9e de trois enfants. Research and teaching interests Qu\u00e9bec literature and culture Poetry Geopoetics, theories of landscape Ecocriticism, ecofeminism Regionality, migrations, tourism, postindustrial places Literature and cultural studies of francophone minorities in Canada Theories of care and intersectionality; the dynamics of power on minorities or marginalized groups Literature and visual arts Domaines d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la recherche et l\u2019enseignement Litt\u00e9rature et culture qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises Po\u00e9sie G\u00e9opo\u00e9tique, th\u00e9ories du paysage \u00c9copo\u00e9tique, \u00e9cof\u00e9minisme R\u00e9gionalit\u00e9, migrations, tourisme et lieux postindustriels Litt\u00e9rature et \u00e9tudes culturelles des minorit\u00e9s de la francophonie canadienne Th\u00e9ories du care et de l\u2019intersectionnalit\u00e9; les dynamiques de pouvoir envers les minorit\u00e9s ou des groupes marginalis\u00e9s Litt\u00e9rature et arts visuels Current projects My current research project, entitled \u201cFrom Land to Landscape: Qu\u00e9bec poetry in perspective since 1950\u201d (SSRHC 2016-2019), examines the evolution of Qu\u00e9bec poetry. The \u201cpoetry from the land\u201d in the 1950s and 1960s was centered on the political concepts of land and country. Some of the most famous poems of that time represented Qu\u00e9bec land in a very lyrical and abstract manner through decontextualized natural elements. My observation of contemporary creation since the 2000\u2019s unveils what is both a return to the representation of non-urbanized areas \u2013 that I theorized in my first book -, and a change of perspective. To me, one of the dominant traits of current Qu\u00e9bec poetry lies in its realism and its close attention to aesthetics, whereby emphasis is no longer on the land, but its landscapes. My objective consists in illustrating this shift from the politics of the land to the aesthetic landscape. I analyze the concept of landscape at the intersection of the theories of geopoetics and ecopoetics. Indeed, the landscape is not the mere representation of a place but constitutes a complex living environment intertwined with relationships. Thus, this project tackles wider issues such as the transformation of our post-industrial environments, conservation and sustainability of unique landscapes, the impacts of tourism and migrations on communities and ecosystems, the division of resources and representations between (political, demographic, and economical) centres and marginalized regions. Within the framework of this project, I conduct interviews with authors and artists. Some of the videos can be found on the website of the project: https://uwaterloo.ca/pays-paysage/ Projets en cours Mon projet de recherche actuel, intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Du pays au paysage. La po\u00e9sie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise en perspective depuis 1950 \u00bb (CRSH 2016-2019), \u00e9tudie l\u2019\u00e9volution de la po\u00e9sie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. La po\u00e9sie du pays des ann\u00e9es 1950 et 1960 \u00e9tait centr\u00e9e sur le concept politique de pays, qu\u2019elle \u00e9voquait de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 la fois lyrique et d\u00e9sincarn\u00e9e \u00e0 travers des \u00e9l\u00e9ments naturels souvent isol\u00e9s, d\u00e9contextualis\u00e9s. Depuis 2000, j\u2019observe dans la cr\u00e9ation contemporaine ce qui est \u00e0 la fois un retour \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation d\u2019espaces non urbanis\u00e9s \u2013 que je d\u00e9signais par le terme de \u00ab confins \u00bb dans mon premier livre \u2013, et un changement de perspective. Ce qui me para\u00eet dominer au sein de toute une portion de la po\u00e9sie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise actuelle est son r\u00e9alisme et son attention \u00e0 l\u2019esth\u00e9tique, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire non plus au pays, mais \u00e0 ses paysages. Mon objectif consiste donc \u00e0 illustrer ce d\u00e9placement du pays politique au paysage esth\u00e9tique. J\u2019\u00e9tudie le concept de paysage en croisant les th\u00e9ories de la g\u00e9opo\u00e9tique et de l\u2019\u00e9copo\u00e9tique. En effet, le paysage n\u2019est pas seulement la repr\u00e9sentation d\u2019un lieu, mais constitue un milieu de vie complexe tiss\u00e9 de relations. Ce projet aborde donc de plus larges questions telles que la transformation de nos espaces de vie \u00e0 l\u2019heure postindustrielle, la pr\u00e9servation et la durabilit\u00e9 de paysages uniques, les impacts du tourisme et des migrations sur les communaut\u00e9s et les \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes, le partage des ressources et des repr\u00e9sentations entre les centres (politiques, d\u00e9mographiques et \u00e9conomiques) et les r\u00e9gions marginalis\u00e9s.

I grew up in the beautiful French Alps where I completed my undergraduate studies and undertook my first research project in comparative literature. Initially, I came to Canada as an exchange student at Queen\u2019s University (Kingston, Ontario). Through this experience, I discovered Qu\u00e9bec literature and developed a passion for it. I returned to France, in Lyon this time, to undertake a Master thesis on the construction of identity and otherness in marginal areas, the settings of most of Louis Hamelin\u2019s early novels. I then moved to Vancouver to complete a PhD in contemporary Qu\u00e9bec literature. My doctoral thesis addressed questions more broadly linked to the representation of marginal sites in novels, poems, and essays by the authors Pierre Morency, Pierre Nepveu, and Louis Hamelin. My first position as Assistant Professor was at Universit\u00e9 Saint-Boniface, in the French community of Winnipeg. Over the course of this one-year position, my interest for the francophone minorities in Canada started to translate in research publications. I came to the University of Waterloo as a Lecturer in 2010 and was appointed as a Faculty member in 2011. My teaching and research focuses mainly on the two fields of Qu\u00e9bec and francophone minorities studies. Some of the key concepts that I reflect on are the transformation of landscapes, regional dynamics, conservation and sustainability, tourism, migrations, memory, and power relations imposed on various minorities or marginalized groups. I am also actively involved as a professional and community member by volunteering and holding positions on executive boards and associations. Last but not least, I am the proud mother of three children.

I grew up in the beautiful French Alps where I completed my undergraduate studies and undertook my first research project in comparative literature. Initially, I came to Canada as an exchange student at Queen\u2019s University (Kingston, Ontario). Through this experience, I discovered Qu\u00e9bec literature and developed a passion for it. I returned to France, in Lyon this time, to undertake a Master thesis on the construction of identity and otherness in marginal areas, the settings of most of Louis Hamelin\u2019s early novels. I then moved to Vancouver to complete a PhD in contemporary Qu\u00e9bec literature. My doctoral thesis addressed questions more broadly linked to the representation of marginal sites in novels, poems, and essays by the authors Pierre Morency, Pierre Nepveu, and Louis Hamelin. My first position as Assistant Professor was at Universit\u00e9 Saint-Boniface, in the French community of Winnipeg. Over the course of this one-year position, my interest for the francophone minorities in Canada started to translate in research publications. I came to the University of Waterloo as a Lecturer in 2010 and was appointed as a Faculty member in 2011. My teaching and research focuses mainly on the two fields of Qu\u00e9bec and francophone minorities studies. Some of the key concepts that I reflect on are the transformation of landscapes, regional dynamics, conservation and sustainability, tourism, migrations, memory, and power relations imposed on various minorities or marginalized groups. I am also actively involved as a professional and community member by volunteering and holding positions on executive boards and associations. Last but not least, I am the proud mother of three children. Biographie Mon int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les lieux, les paysages et les distances est li\u00e9 aux divers endroits o\u00f9 j\u2019ai v\u00e9cu. J\u2019ai grandi dans les magnifiques Alpes fran\u00e7aises, o\u00f9 j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 mes \u00e9tudes. Mon premier projet de recherche \u00e9tait en litt\u00e9rature compar\u00e9e. Je suis initialement venue au Canada pour la premi\u00e8re fois en tant qu\u2019\u00e9tudiante d\u2019\u00e9change \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Queen\u2019s (Kingston, Ontario). C\u2019est au cours de cette exp\u00e9rience que j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert la litt\u00e9rature qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise qui m\u2019a tout de suite passionn\u00e9e. Je suis retourn\u00e9e en France, \u00e0 Lyon cette fois-ci, pour entreprendre une th\u00e8se de ma\u00eetrise (Master 2) sur la construction de l\u2019identit\u00e9 et de l\u2019alt\u00e9rit\u00e9 dans les espaces marginaux o\u00f9 Louis Hamelin situe la plupart des intrigues de ses premiers romans. J\u2019ai ensuite d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9aliser ma th\u00e8se de doctorat en litt\u00e9rature qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise contemporaine, \u00e9tudiant plus largement les repr\u00e9sentations des espaces marginaux dans les romans, les po\u00e8mes et les essais des auteurs Pierre Morency, Pierre Nepveu et Louis Hamelin. Mon premier poste comme professeure adjointe \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Saint-Boniface, dans la communaut\u00e9 francophone de Winnipeg. Au cours de cette ann\u00e9e au Manitoba, mon int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les minorit\u00e9s francophones du Canada a alors commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se traduire en publications de recherche. Je suis d\u2019abord arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Waterloo comme lectrice en 2010, puis ai acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de professeure en 2011. Je poursuis mes recherches dans ces deux champs, des \u00e9tudes qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises et des minorit\u00e9s francophones. Quelques-uns des concepts cl\u00e9s qui nourrissent ma r\u00e9flexion sont la transformation des paysages, la dynamique des r\u00e9gions, la pr\u00e9servation et la durabilit\u00e9, le tourisme, les migrations, la m\u00e9moire et les dynamiques de pouvoir impos\u00e9es \u00e0 diverses minorit\u00e9s ou \u00e0 des groupes marginalis\u00e9s. Par ailleurs, je suis aussi une membre active sur les plans professionnel et communautaire : je fais du b\u00e9n\u00e9volat, suis membre de plusieurs associations et membre de comit\u00e9s ex\u00e9cutifs. Enfin et surtout, je suis la maman combl\u00e9e de trois enfants. Research and teaching interests Qu\u00e9bec literature and culture Poetry Geopoetics, theories of landscape Ecocriticism, ecofeminism Regionality, migrations, tourism, postindustrial places Literature and cultural studies of francophone minorities in Canada Theories of care and intersectionality; the dynamics of power on minorities or marginalized groups Literature and visual arts Domaines d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la recherche et l\u2019enseignement Litt\u00e9rature et culture qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises Po\u00e9sie G\u00e9opo\u00e9tique, th\u00e9ories du paysage \u00c9copo\u00e9tique, \u00e9cof\u00e9minisme R\u00e9gionalit\u00e9, migrations, tourisme et lieux postindustriels Litt\u00e9rature et \u00e9tudes culturelles des minorit\u00e9s de la francophonie canadienne Th\u00e9ories du care et de l\u2019intersectionnalit\u00e9; les dynamiques de pouvoir envers les minorit\u00e9s ou des groupes marginalis\u00e9s Litt\u00e9rature et arts visuels Current projects My current research project, entitled \u201cFrom Land to Landscape: Qu\u00e9bec poetry in perspective since 1950\u201d (SSRHC 2016-2019), examines the evolution of Qu\u00e9bec poetry. The \u201cpoetry from the land\u201d in the 1950s and 1960s was centered on the political concepts of land and country. Some of the most famous poems of that time represented Qu\u00e9bec land in a very lyrical and abstract manner through decontextualized natural elements. My observation of contemporary creation since the 2000\u2019s unveils what is both a return to the representation of non-urbanized areas \u2013 that I theorized in my first book -, and a change of perspective. To me, one of the dominant traits of current Qu\u00e9bec poetry lies in its realism and its close attention to aesthetics, whereby emphasis is no longer on the land, but its landscapes. My objective consists in illustrating this shift from the politics of the land to the aesthetic landscape. I analyze the concept of landscape at the intersection of the theories of geopoetics and ecopoetics. Indeed, the landscape is not the mere representation of a place but constitutes a complex living environment intertwined with relationships. Thus, this project tackles wider issues such as the transformation of our post-industrial environments, conservation and sustainability of unique landscapes, the impacts of tourism and migrations on communities and ecosystems, the division of resources and representations between (political, demographic, and economical) centres and marginalized regions. Within the framework of this project, I conduct interviews with authors and artists. Some of the videos can be found on the website of the project: https://uwaterloo.ca/pays-paysage/ Projets en cours Mon projet de recherche actuel, intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Du pays au paysage. La po\u00e9sie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise en perspective depuis 1950 \u00bb (CRSH 2016-2019), \u00e9tudie l\u2019\u00e9volution de la po\u00e9sie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. La po\u00e9sie du pays des ann\u00e9es 1950 et 1960 \u00e9tait centr\u00e9e sur le concept politique de pays, qu\u2019elle \u00e9voquait de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 la fois lyrique et d\u00e9sincarn\u00e9e \u00e0 travers des \u00e9l\u00e9ments naturels souvent isol\u00e9s, d\u00e9contextualis\u00e9s. Depuis 2000, j\u2019observe dans la cr\u00e9ation contemporaine ce qui est \u00e0 la fois un retour \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation d\u2019espaces non urbanis\u00e9s \u2013 que je d\u00e9signais par le terme de \u00ab confins \u00bb dans mon premier livre \u2013, et un changement de perspective. Ce qui me para\u00eet dominer au sein de toute une portion de la po\u00e9sie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise actuelle est son r\u00e9alisme et son attention \u00e0 l\u2019esth\u00e9tique, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire non plus au pays, mais \u00e0 ses paysages. Mon objectif consiste donc \u00e0 illustrer ce d\u00e9placement du pays politique au paysage esth\u00e9tique. J\u2019\u00e9tudie le concept de paysage en croisant les th\u00e9ories de la g\u00e9opo\u00e9tique et de l\u2019\u00e9copo\u00e9tique. En effet, le paysage n\u2019est pas seulement la repr\u00e9sentation d\u2019un lieu, mais constitue un milieu de vie complexe tiss\u00e9 de relations. Ce projet aborde donc de plus larges questions telles que la transformation de nos espaces de vie \u00e0 l\u2019heure postindustrielle, la pr\u00e9servation et la durabilit\u00e9 de paysages uniques, les impacts du tourisme et des migrations sur les communaut\u00e9s et les \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes, le partage des ressources et des repr\u00e9sentations entre les centres (politiques, d\u00e9mographiques et \u00e9conomiques) et les r\u00e9gions marginalis\u00e9s.

Some of the videos can be found on the website of the project: https://uwaterloo.ca/pays-paysage/ Projets en cours Mon projet de recherche actuel, intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Du pays au paysage. La po\u00e9sie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise en perspective depuis 1950 \u00bb (CRSH 2016-2019), \u00e9tudie l\u2019\u00e9volution de la po\u00e9sie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. La po\u00e9sie du pays des ann\u00e9es 1950 et 1960 \u00e9tait centr\u00e9e sur le concept politique de pays, qu\u2019elle \u00e9voquait de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 la fois lyrique et d\u00e9sincarn\u00e9e \u00e0 travers des \u00e9l\u00e9ments naturels souvent isol\u00e9s, d\u00e9contextualis\u00e9s. Depuis 2000, j\u2019observe dans la cr\u00e9ation contemporaine ce qui est \u00e0 la fois un retour \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation d\u2019espaces non urbanis\u00e9s \u2013 que je d\u00e9signais par le terme de \u00ab confins \u00bb dans mon premier livre \u2013, et un changement de perspective. Ce qui me para\u00eet dominer au sein de toute une portion de la po\u00e9sie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise actuelle est son r\u00e9alisme et son attention \u00e0 l\u2019esth\u00e9tique, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire non plus au pays, mais \u00e0 ses paysages. Mon objectif consiste donc \u00e0 illustrer ce d\u00e9placement du pays politique au paysage esth\u00e9tique. J\u2019\u00e9tudie le concept de paysage en croisant les th\u00e9ories de la g\u00e9opo\u00e9tique et de l\u2019\u00e9copo\u00e9tique. En effet, le paysage n\u2019est pas seulement la repr\u00e9sentation d\u2019un lieu, mais constitue un milieu de vie complexe tiss\u00e9 de relations. Ce projet aborde donc de plus larges questions telles que la transformation de nos espaces de vie \u00e0 l\u2019heure postindustrielle, la pr\u00e9servation et la durabilit\u00e9 de paysages uniques, les impacts du tourisme et des migrations sur les communaut\u00e9s et les \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes, le partage des ressources et des repr\u00e9sentations entre les centres (politiques, d\u00e9mographiques et \u00e9conomiques) et les r\u00e9gions marginalis\u00e9s.

I grew up in the beautiful French Alps where I completed my undergraduate studies and undertook my first research project in comparative literature. Initially, I came to Canada as an exchange student at Queen\u2019s University (Kingston, Ontario). Through this experience, I discovered Qu\u00e9bec literature and developed a passion for it. I returned to France, in Lyon this time, to undertake a Master thesis on the construction of identity and otherness in marginal areas, the settings of most of Louis Hamelin\u2019s early novels. I then moved to Vancouver to complete a PhD in contemporary Qu\u00e9bec literature. My doctoral thesis addressed questions more broadly linked to the representation of marginal sites in novels, poems, and essays by the authors Pierre Morency, Pierre Nepveu, and Louis Hamelin. My first position as Assistant Professor was at Universit\u00e9 Saint-Boniface, in the French community of Winnipeg. Over the course of this one-year position, my interest for the francophone minorities in Canada started to translate in research publications. I came to the University of Waterloo as a Lecturer in 2010 and was appointed as a Faculty member in 2011. My teaching and research focuses mainly on the two fields of Qu\u00e9bec and francophone minorities studies. Some of the key concepts that I reflect on are the transformation of landscapes, regional dynamics, conservation and sustainability, tourism, migrations, memory, and power relations imposed on various minorities or marginalized groups. I am also actively involved as a professional and community member by volunteering and holding positions on executive boards and associations. Last but not least, I am the proud mother of three children. Biographie Mon int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les lieux, les paysages et les distances est li\u00e9 aux divers endroits o\u00f9 j\u2019ai v\u00e9cu. J\u2019ai grandi dans les magnifiques Alpes fran\u00e7aises, o\u00f9 j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 mes \u00e9tudes. Mon premier projet de recherche \u00e9tait en litt\u00e9rature compar\u00e9e. Je suis initialement venue au Canada pour la premi\u00e8re fois en tant qu\u2019\u00e9tudiante d\u2019\u00e9change \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Queen\u2019s (Kingston, Ontario). C\u2019est au cours de cette exp\u00e9rience que j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert la litt\u00e9rature qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise qui m\u2019a tout de suite passionn\u00e9e. Je suis retourn\u00e9e en France, \u00e0 Lyon cette fois-ci, pour entreprendre une th\u00e8se de ma\u00eetrise (Master 2) sur la construction de l\u2019identit\u00e9 et de l\u2019alt\u00e9rit\u00e9 dans les espaces marginaux o\u00f9 Louis Hamelin situe la plupart des intrigues de ses premiers romans. J\u2019ai ensuite d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9aliser ma th\u00e8se de doctorat en litt\u00e9rature qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise contemporaine, \u00e9tudiant plus largement les repr\u00e9sentations des espaces marginaux dans les romans, les po\u00e8mes et les essais des auteurs Pierre Morency, Pierre Nepveu et Louis Hamelin. Mon premier poste comme professeure adjointe \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Saint-Boniface, dans la communaut\u00e9 francophone de Winnipeg. Au cours de cette ann\u00e9e au Manitoba, mon int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les minorit\u00e9s francophones du Canada a alors commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se traduire en publications de recherche. Je suis d\u2019abord arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Waterloo comme lectrice en 2010, puis ai acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de professeure en 2011. Je poursuis mes recherches dans ces deux champs, des \u00e9tudes qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises et des minorit\u00e9s francophones. Quelques-uns des concepts cl\u00e9s qui nourrissent ma r\u00e9flexion sont la transformation des paysages, la dynamique des r\u00e9gions, la pr\u00e9servation et la durabilit\u00e9, le tourisme, les migrations, la m\u00e9moire et les dynamiques de pouvoir impos\u00e9es \u00e0 diverses minorit\u00e9s ou \u00e0 des groupes marginalis\u00e9s. Par ailleurs, je suis aussi une membre active sur les plans professionnel et communautaire : je fais du b\u00e9n\u00e9volat, suis membre de plusieurs associations et membre de comit\u00e9s ex\u00e9cutifs. Enfin et surtout, je suis la maman combl\u00e9e de trois enfants.

The \u201cpoetry from the land\u201d in the 1950s and 1960s was centered on the political concepts of land and country. Some of the most famous poems of that time represented Qu\u00e9bec land in a very lyrical and abstract manner through decontextualized natural elements. My observation of contemporary creation since the 2000\u2019s unveils what is both a return to the representation of non-urbanized areas \u2013 that I theorized in my first book -, and a change of perspective. To me, one of the dominant traits of current Qu\u00e9bec poetry lies in its realism and its close attention to aesthetics, whereby emphasis is no longer on the land, but its landscapes. My objective consists in illustrating this shift from the politics of the land to the aesthetic landscape. I analyze the concept of landscape at the intersection of the theories of geopoetics and ecopoetics. Indeed, the landscape is not the mere representation of a place but constitutes a complex living environment intertwined with relationships. Thus, this project tackles wider issues such as the transformation of our post-industrial environments, conservation and sustainability of unique landscapes, the impacts of tourism and migrations on communities and ecosystems, the division of resources and representations between (political, demographic, and economical) centres and marginalized regions. Within the framework of this project, I conduct interviews with authors and artists.

Initially, I came to Canada as an exchange student at Queen\u2019s University (Kingston, Ontario). Through this experience, I discovered Qu\u00e9bec literature and developed a passion for it. I returned to France, in Lyon this time, to undertake a Master thesis on the construction of identity and otherness in marginal areas, the settings of most of Louis Hamelin\u2019s early novels. I then moved to Vancouver to complete a PhD in contemporary Qu\u00e9bec literature. My doctoral thesis addressed questions more broadly linked to the representation of marginal sites in novels, poems, and essays by the authors Pierre Morency, Pierre Nepveu, and Louis Hamelin. My first position as Assistant Professor was at Universit\u00e9 Saint-Boniface, in the French community of Winnipeg. Over the course of this one-year position, my interest for the francophone minorities in Canada started to translate in research publications. I came to the University of Waterloo as a Lecturer in 2010 and was appointed as a Faculty member in 2011. My teaching and research focuses mainly on the two fields of Qu\u00e9bec and francophone minorities studies. Some of the key concepts that I reflect on are the transformation of landscapes, regional dynamics, conservation and sustainability, tourism, migrations, memory, and power relations imposed on various minorities or marginalized groups. I am also actively involved as a professional and community member by volunteering and holding positions on executive boards and associations. Last but not least, I am the proud mother of three children.\n Biographie\n Mon int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les lieux, les paysages et les distances est li\u00e9 aux divers endroits o\u00f9 j\u2019ai v\u00e9cu. J\u2019ai grandi dans les magnifiques Alpes fran\u00e7aises, o\u00f9 j\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 mes \u00e9tudes. Mon premier projet de recherche \u00e9tait en litt\u00e9rature compar\u00e9e. Je suis initialement venue au Canada pour la premi\u00e8re fois en tant qu\u2019\u00e9tudiante d\u2019\u00e9change \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Queen\u2019s (Kingston, Ontario). C\u2019est au cours de cette exp\u00e9rience que j\u2019ai d\u00e9couvert la litt\u00e9rature qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise qui m\u2019a tout de suite passionn\u00e9e. Je suis retourn\u00e9e en France, \u00e0 Lyon cette fois-ci, pour entreprendre une th\u00e8se de ma\u00eetrise (Master 2) sur la construction de l\u2019identit\u00e9 et de l\u2019alt\u00e9rit\u00e9 dans les espaces marginaux o\u00f9 Louis Hamelin situe la plupart des intrigues de ses premiers romans. J\u2019ai ensuite d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9aliser ma th\u00e8se de doctorat en litt\u00e9rature qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise contemporaine, \u00e9tudiant plus largement les repr\u00e9sentations des espaces marginaux dans les romans, les po\u00e8mes et les essais des auteurs Pierre Morency, Pierre Nepveu et Louis Hamelin. Mon premier poste comme professeure adjointe \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Saint-Boniface, dans la communaut\u00e9 francophone de Winnipeg. Au cours de cette ann\u00e9e au Manitoba, mon int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les minorit\u00e9s francophones du Canada a alors commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se traduire en publications de recherche. Je suis d\u2019abord arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Waterloo comme lectrice en 2010, puis ai acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de professeure en 2011. Je poursuis mes recherches dans ces deux champs, des \u00e9tudes qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises et des minorit\u00e9s francophones. Quelques-uns des concepts cl\u00e9s qui nourrissent ma r\u00e9flexion sont la transformation des paysages, la dynamique des r\u00e9gions, la pr\u00e9servation et la durabilit\u00e9, le tourisme, les migrations, la m\u00e9moire et les dynamiques de pouvoir impos\u00e9es \u00e0 diverses minorit\u00e9s ou \u00e0 des groupes marginalis\u00e9s. Par ailleurs, je suis aussi une membre active sur les plans professionnel et communautaire : je fais du b\u00e9n\u00e9volat, suis membre de plusieurs associations et membre de comit\u00e9s ex\u00e9cutifs. Enfin et surtout, je suis la maman combl\u00e9e de trois enfants. \n Research and teaching interests\n Research and teaching interests\n Qu\u00e9bec literature and culture Poetry Geopoetics, theories of landscape Ecocriticism, ecofeminism Regionality, migrations, tourism, postindustrial places Literature and cultural studies of francophone minorities in Canada Theories of care and intersectionality; the dynamics of power on minorities or marginalized groups Literature and visual arts \n Qu\u00e9bec literature and culture \n Qu\u00e9bec literature and culture\n Qu\u00e9bec literature and culture\n Qu\u00e9bec literature and culture\n Poetry \n Poetry\n Poetry\n Poetry\n Geopoetics, theories of landscape \n Geopoetics, theories of landscape\n Geopoetics, theories of landscape\n Geopoetics, theories of landscape\n Ecocriticism, ecofeminism \n Ecocriticism, ecofeminism\n Ecocriticism, ecofeminism\n Ecocriticism, ecofeminism\n Regionality, migrations, tourism, postindustrial places \n Regionality, migrations, tourism, postindustrial places\n Regionality, migrations, tourism, postindustrial places\n Regionality, migrations, tourism, postindustrial places\n Literature and cultural studies of francophone minorities in Canada \n Literature and cultural studies of francophone minorities in Canada\n Literature and cultural studies of francophone minorities in Canada\n Literature and cultural studies of francophone minorities in Canada\n Theories of care and intersectionality; the dynamics of power on minorities or marginalized groups \n Theories of care and intersectionality; the dynamics of power on minorities or marginalized groups\n Theories of care and intersectionality; the dynamics of power on minorities or marginalized groups\n Theories of care and intersectionality; the dynamics of power\n on minorities or marginalized groups\n Literature and visual arts \n Literature and visual arts\n Literature and visual arts\n Literature and visual arts\n Domaines d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la recherche et l\u2019enseignement\n Domaines d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la recherche et l\u2019enseignement\n Domaines d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la recherche et l\u2019enseignement\n Domaines d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la recherche et l\u2019enseignement\n Litt\u00e9rature et culture qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises Po\u00e9sie G\u00e9opo\u00e9tique, th\u00e9ories du paysage \u00c9copo\u00e9tique, \u00e9cof\u00e9minisme R\u00e9gionalit\u00e9, migrations, tourisme et lieux postindustriels Litt\u00e9rature et \u00e9tudes culturelles des minorit\u00e9s de la francophonie canadienne Th\u00e9ories du care et de l\u2019intersectionnalit\u00e9; les dynamiques de pouvoir envers les minorit\u00e9s ou des groupes marginalis\u00e9s Litt\u00e9rature et arts visuels \n Litt\u00e9rature et culture qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises \n Litt\u00e9rature et culture qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises\n Litt\u00e9rature et culture qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises\n Po\u00e9sie \n Po\u00e9sie\n Po\u00e9sie\n G\u00e9opo\u00e9tique, th\u00e9ories du paysage \n G\u00e9opo\u00e9tique, th\u00e9ories du paysage\n G\u00e9opo\u00e9tique, th\u00e9ories du paysage\n \u00c9copo\u00e9tique, \u00e9cof\u00e9minisme \n \u00c9copo\u00e9tique, \u00e9cof\u00e9minisme\n \u00c9copo\u00e9tique, \u00e9cof\u00e9minisme\n R\u00e9gionalit\u00e9, migrations, tourisme et lieux postindustriels \n R\u00e9gionalit\u00e9, migrations, tourisme et lieux postindustriels\n R\u00e9gionalit\u00e9, migrations, tourisme et lieux postindustriels\n Litt\u00e9rature et \u00e9tudes culturelles des minorit\u00e9s de la francophonie canadienne \n Litt\u00e9rature et \u00e9tudes culturelles des minorit\u00e9s de la francophonie canadienne\n Litt\u00e9rature et \u00e9tudes culturelles des minorit\u00e9s de la francophonie canadienne\n Th\u00e9ories du care et de l\u2019intersectionnalit\u00e9; les dynamiques de pouvoir envers les minorit\u00e9s ou des groupes marginalis\u00e9s \n Th\u00e9ories du care et de l\u2019intersectionnalit\u00e9; les dynamiques de pouvoir envers les minorit\u00e9s ou des groupes marginalis\u00e9s\n Th\u00e9ories du care et de l\u2019intersectionnalit\u00e9; les dynamiques de pouvoir envers les minorit\u00e9s ou des groupes marginalis\u00e9s\n Litt\u00e9rature et arts visuels \n Litt\u00e9rature et arts visuels\n Litt\u00e9rature et arts visuels\n Current projects\n Current projects\n My current research project, entitled \u201cFrom Land to Landscape: Qu\u00e9bec poetry in perspective since 1950\u201d (SSRHC 2016-2019), examines the evolution of Qu\u00e9bec poetry. The \u201cpoetry from the land\u201d in the 1950s and 1960s was centered on the political concepts of land and country. Some of the most famous poems of that time represented Qu\u00e9bec land in a very lyrical and abstract manner through decontextualized natural elements. My observation of contemporary creation since the 2000\u2019s unveils what is both a return to the representation of non-urbanized areas \u2013 that I theorized in my first book -, and a change of perspective. To me, one of the dominant traits of current Qu\u00e9bec poetry lies in its realism and its close attention to aesthetics, whereby emphasis is no longer on the land, but its landscapes. My objective consists in illustrating this shift from the politics of the land to the aesthetic landscape. \n I analyze the concept of landscape at the intersection of the theories of geopoetics and ecopoetics. Indeed, the landscape is not the mere representation of a place but constitutes a complex living environment intertwined with relationships. Thus, this project tackles wider issues such as the transformation of our post-industrial environments, conservation and sustainability of unique landscapes, the impacts of tourism and migrations on communities and ecosystems, the division of resources and representations between (political, demographic, and economical) centres and marginalized regions. \n Within the framework of this project, I conduct interviews with authors and artists. Some of the videos can be found on the website of the project: https://uwaterloo.ca/pays-paysage/ \n https://uwaterloo.ca/pays-paysage/\n Projets en cours\n Mon projet de recherche actuel, intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Du pays au paysage. La po\u00e9sie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise en perspective depuis 1950 \u00bb (CRSH 2016-2019), \u00e9tudie l\u2019\u00e9volution de la po\u00e9sie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. La po\u00e9sie du pays des ann\u00e9es 1950 et 1960 \u00e9tait centr\u00e9e sur le concept politique de pays, qu\u2019elle \u00e9voquait de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 la fois lyrique et d\u00e9sincarn\u00e9e \u00e0 travers des \u00e9l\u00e9ments naturels souvent isol\u00e9s, d\u00e9contextualis\u00e9s. Depuis 2000, j\u2019observe dans la cr\u00e9ation contemporaine ce qui est \u00e0 la fois un retour \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation d\u2019espaces non urbanis\u00e9s \u2013 que je d\u00e9signais par le terme de \u00ab confins \u00bb dans mon premier livre \u2013, et un changement de perspective. Ce qui me para\u00eet dominer au sein de toute une portion de la po\u00e9sie qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise actuelle est son r\u00e9alisme et son attention \u00e0 l\u2019esth\u00e9tique, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire non plus au pays, mais \u00e0 ses paysages. Mon objectif consiste donc \u00e0 illustrer ce d\u00e9placement du pays politique au paysage esth\u00e9tique. \n J\u2019\u00e9tudie le concept de paysage en croisant les th\u00e9ories de la g\u00e9opo\u00e9tique et de l\u2019\u00e9copo\u00e9tique. En effet, le paysage n\u2019est pas seulement la repr\u00e9sentation d\u2019un lieu, mais constitue un milieu de vie complexe tiss\u00e9 de relations. Ce projet aborde donc de plus larges questions telles que la transformation de nos espaces de vie \u00e0 l\u2019heure postindustrielle, la pr\u00e9servation et la durabilit\u00e9 de paysages uniques, les impacts du tourisme et des migrations sur les communaut\u00e9s et les \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes, le partage des ressources et des repr\u00e9sentations entre les centres (politiques, d\u00e9mographiques et \u00e9conomiques) et les r\u00e9gions marginalis\u00e9s. \n Dans le cadre de ce projet, je r\u00e9alise des entretiens avec des auteurs et des artistes, dont des capsules vid\u00e9os se trouvent sur le site internet du projet : https://uwaterloo.ca/pays-paysage/. \n https://uwaterloo.ca/pays-paysage/\n Selected publications\n Selected publications\n Book \n Book\n Book\n G\u00e9ographie des confins, Ottawa, \u00c9ditions David, Coll. \u00ab Voix savantes \u00bb, 2016. \n G\u00e9ographie des confins, Ottawa, \u00c9ditions David, Coll. \u00ab Voix savantes \u00bb, 2016. \n G\u00e9ographie des confins, Ottawa, \u00c9ditions David, Coll. \u00ab Voix savantes \u00bb, 2016.\n G\u00e9ographie des confins, Ottawa, \u00c9ditions David, Coll. \u00ab Voix savantes \u00bb, 2016.\n G\u00e9ographie des confins\n Edited Book \n Edited Book\n Edited Book\n \u00c9lise Lepage et Isabelle Miron (dir.), Imaginaire du terrain vague, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res (Qu\u00e9bec), \u00c9ditions Le Sabord, 2019. \n \u00c9lise Lepage et Isabelle Miron (dir.), Imaginaire du terrain vague, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res (Qu\u00e9bec), \u00c9ditions Le Sabord, 2019. \n \u00c9lise Lepage et Isabelle Miron (dir.), Imaginaire du terrain vague, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res (Qu\u00e9bec), \u00c9ditions Le Sabord, 2019.\n \u00c9lise Lepage et Isabelle Miron (dir.), Imaginaire du terrain vague, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res (Qu\u00e9bec), \u00c9ditions Le Sabord, 2019.\n \u00c9lise Lepage et Isabelle Miron (dir.), Imaginaire du terrain vague, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res (Qu\u00e9bec), \u00c9ditions Le Sabord, 2019.\n Most Recent Journal Issue Edited \n Most Recent Journal Issue Edited\n Most Recent Journal Issue Edited\n \u00ab Cadrages contemporains sur les paysages des litt\u00e9ratures francophones canadiennes \u00bb, Temps z\u00e9ro, n\u00b0 10, Fall 2015, http://tempszero.contemporain.info/document1308 \n \u00ab Cadrages contemporains sur les paysages des litt\u00e9ratures francophones canadiennes \u00bb, Temps z\u00e9ro, n\u00b0 10, Fall 2015, http://tempszero.contemporain.info/document1308 \n \u00ab Cadrages contemporains sur les paysages des litt\u00e9ratures francophones canadiennes \u00bb, Temps z\u00e9ro, n\u00b0 10, Fall 2015, http://tempszero.contemporain.info/document1308\n \u00ab Cadrages contemporains sur les paysages des litt\u00e9ratures francophones canadiennes \u00bb, Temps z\u00e9ro, n\u00b0 10, Fall 2015, http://tempszero.contemporain.info/document1308\nTemps z\u00e9ro\nhttp://tempszero.contemporain.info/document1308\n Selected Articles and Chapters \n Selected Articles and Chapters\n Selected Articles and Chapters\n \u00ab Paul Malenfant, fen\u00eatres sur l\u2019int\u00e9rieur \u00bb, Sensorielles.

Curriculum Vitae (PDF) \n ammiraglia@uwaterloo.ca BA, MA, PhD (Toronto) Professor Anne Marie Miraglia is a specialist of francophone novelists from Black and Arab Africa, Qu\u00e9bec and the French Caribbean. Her research includes literary theory, semiotics, narratology and feminist criticism. She also works on questions of cultural hybridity and cultural identity. Her present research focuses on writers from Africa who have immigrated to France or to Quebec and who write about the immigrant and clandestine experience. Professor Miraglia has published two books. The first, L'\u00c9criture de l'Autre chez Jacques Poulin (Qu\u00e9bec, 1993) applies the concepts of \"dialogisme\" (Mikha\u00efl Bakhtine) and of \"intertextualit\u00e9\" (Kristeva, Todorov, Riffaterre) to the novels of Jacques Poulin and to other Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois novels in their relation to American fiction. The second book, Des Voix contre le silence (Durham University, UK, 2005) studies the narrative techniques used in nine novels written in French by women writers from the Maghreb (Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco) to comment on the condition of women in traditional Muslim societies. Professor Miraglia has published numerous papers on a variety of francophone novelists. These include well known writers such as Assia Djebar (Algeria), Maryse Cond\u00e9 (Guadeloupe) and Andr\u00e9e Chedid (Egypt ) and on less familiar writers living in the Maghreb such as Emna Bel Haj Yahia (Tunisia). She has also published studies on Canadian born novelist Nino Ricci, on Haitian born novelist Dany Laferri\u00e8re, and on French \"second-generation immigrant\" (\"Beurs\") novelists Azouz Begag, Tassadit Imache and Farida Belghoul.

I have been working at the University of Waterloo since 2001. My primary field of research is 20th- and 21st-century French literature, with publications on authors as diverse as Andr\u00e9 Gide, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Am\u00e9lie Nothomb, Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re, Colette Fellous, and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lenoir. My theoretical approach is grounded in Bakhtin studies, with a particular interest in the concept of the chronotope. I have published several articles that are primarily reflections on theoretical concepts relating to the representation of time and space in literature. In addition to publishing on French literature, I continue to maintain an interest in English literature, and have co-authored an article on Shakespeare as well as several articles on English/French adaptations. Research and Teaching Interests 20th- and 21st-century French Literature Bakhtin Studies Time and Space in the Novel/Bakhtin\u2019s Chronotope Photography and Literature History and Literature Psychology and Literature Adaptation Studies Introduction to Translation Current Projects My current research focusses on two main areas. First, I am exploring the integration of photography into literary texts by examining the interaction between textual description (ekphrasis) and reproduced photos in French literature from the 20th and 21st centuries. Recent publications on Colette Fellous have examined the use of photography in her autobiographical writings. Second, I have been examining the link between literature and history, with publications on literary representations of diverse historical events, from early travel literature to the World Wars. I also continue to publish in the field of Bakhtin studies. Selected Publications Tara Collington's ORCID record Books 2020, Guy Poirier, \u00c9lise Lepage and Tara Collington, eds.

First, I am exploring the integration of photography into literary texts by examining the interaction between textual description (ekphrasis) and reproduced photos in French literature from the 20th and 21st centuries. Recent publications on Colette Fellous have examined the use of photography in her autobiographical writings. Second, I have been examining the link between literature and history, with publications on literary representations of diverse historical events, from early travel literature to the World Wars.

In addition to publishing on French literature, I continue to maintain an interest in English literature, and have co-authored an article on Shakespeare as well as several articles on English/French adaptations. Research and Teaching Interests 20th- and 21st-century French Literature Bakhtin Studies Time and Space in the Novel/Bakhtin\u2019s Chronotope Photography and Literature History and Literature Psychology and Literature Adaptation Studies Introduction to Translation Current Projects My current research focusses on two main areas. First, I am exploring the integration of photography into literary texts by examining the interaction between textual description (ekphrasis) and reproduced photos in French literature from the 20th and 21st centuries. Recent publications on Colette Fellous have examined the use of photography in her autobiographical writings. Second, I have been examining the link between literature and history, with publications on literary representations of diverse historical events, from early travel literature to the World Wars. I also continue to publish in the field of Bakhtin studies. Selected Publications Tara Collington's ORCID record Books 2020, Guy Poirier, \u00c9lise Lepage and Tara Collington, eds.

She is particularly interested in the literary representations of passions, violence, and family romance in works such as diaries, correspondences, memoires, autobiographies, novels, short stories, and plays. Author of a book focusing on the influence of the mother-daughter relationship on writing in Suzanne Necker (1737-1794) and Germaine de Sta\u00ebl\u2019s (1766-1817) works, Dr. Dubeau is currently studying Madame Necker\u2019s manuscripts, preparing the first critical edition of her M\u00e9langes (1798) and Nouveaux m\u00e9langes (1801), five book collectiong personal thoughts, shorts essays, and extracts of her correspondence. Biographie Originaire du Qu\u00e9bec, passionn\u00e9e d\u2019arts, de cin\u00e9ma et de litt\u00e9rature, Catherine Dubeau se sp\u00e9cialise dans la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise du XVIIIe si\u00e8cle.

The M\u00e9langes and Nouveaux m\u00e9langes represent a fascinating editorial mystery, since nobody has yet been able to determine the selections and modifications operated by Necker in his spouse\u2019s manuscripts. When this long term project reaches its end, I will publish an annotated edition of the five volumes and inform the readers about Necker\u2019s interventions throughout the editorial process. The public will then have access for the first time to the transcription of the manuscripts that were not included in the M\u00e9langes and Nouveaux m\u00e9langes.

The M\u00e9langes and Nouveaux m\u00e9langes represent a fascinating editorial mystery, since nobody has yet been able to determine the selections and modifications operated by Necker in his spouse\u2019s manuscripts. When this long term project reaches its end, I will publish an annotated edition of the five volumes and inform the readers about Necker\u2019s interventions throughout the editorial process.

The M\u00e9langes and Nouveaux m\u00e9langes represent a fascinating editorial mystery, since nobody has yet been able to determine the selections and modifications operated by Necker in his spouse\u2019s manuscripts. When this long term project reaches its end, I will publish an annotated edition of the five volumes and inform the readers about Necker\u2019s interventions throughout the editorial process. The public will then have access for the first time to the transcription of the manuscripts that were not included in the M\u00e9langes and Nouveaux m\u00e9langes.

The M\u00e9langes and Nouveaux m\u00e9langes represent a fascinating editorial mystery, since nobody has yet been able to determine the selections and modifications operated by Necker in his spouse\u2019s manuscripts. When this long term project reaches its end, I will publish an annotated edition of the five volumes and inform the readers about Necker\u2019s interventions throughout the editorial process. The public will then have access for the first time to the transcription of the manuscripts that were not included in the M\u00e9langes and Nouveaux m\u00e9langes. \n \n Selected publications Books La lettre et la m\u00e8re : roman familial et \u00e9criture de la passion chez Suzanne Necker et Germaine de Sta\u00ebl, Qu\u00e9bec/Paris, PUL/Hermann, 2013.
