In particular, much of his work has been on analytical inference from longitudinal data collected through complex survey designs involving stratification and clustering. He also has strong research interests in biostatistical methods applied to bone marrow transplant data. Education/biography Before joining the University of Waterloo in June 2005, Professor Boudreau was a member of the Division of Biostatistics and of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) at the Medical College of Wisconsin. He is still involved in collaborative projects on bone marrow research with people at the CIBMTR. Professor Boudreau is the associate director of the Data Management Core (DMC). The DMC aims to ensure data quality and statistical support for the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Survey. This survey is a longitudinal study of an international cohort of more than 10,000 smokers. The project is in collaboration with Professor Mary E. Thompson (Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science), Doctors Geoffrey T. Fong and David Hammond (Department of Psychology), Doctors K. Michael Cummings, Andrew Hyland, and Richard O'Connor (Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, N.Y.), and other international researchers. When it comes to research the focus of Professor Boudreau's work on longitudinal studies has been on developing methods for estimating spell durations and the effects of various covariates on these durations, when data are collected through large-scale longitudinal surveys. These methods are extensions of the Cox model and of the Breslow-Aalen estimator that adjust for correlation between observations belonging to the same cluster. Examples of applications include the duration of jobless spells in Statistics Canada's Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics, and the duration of spells without health care insurance and on different social programs in the U.S. Survey of Income and Program Participation. Professor Boudreau has been the leading statistician on various medical research projects on the time to relapse and the time to death following a blood or bone marrow transplant. Such medical procedures rebuild the patient's white blood cells after their destruction by intensive chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment used to kill cancerous cells. The goal of this research is to understand and to estimate, usually by fitting Cox models, the effects of various prognostic factors on these times to events after transplantation.

In particular, much of his work has been on analytical inference from longitudinal data collected through complex survey designs involving stratification and clustering. He also has strong research interests in biostatistical methods applied to bone marrow transplant data. Education/biography Before joining the University of Waterloo in June 2005, Professor Boudreau was a member of the Division of Biostatistics and of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) at the Medical College of Wisconsin. He is still involved in collaborative projects on bone marrow research with people at the CIBMTR. Professor Boudreau is the associate director of the Data Management Core (DMC). The DMC aims to ensure data quality and statistical support for the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Survey. This survey is a longitudinal study of an international cohort of more than 10,000 smokers. The project is in collaboration with Professor Mary E. Thompson (Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science), Doctors Geoffrey T. Fong and David Hammond (Department of Psychology), Doctors K. Michael Cummings, Andrew Hyland, and Richard O'Connor (Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, N.Y.), and other international researchers. When it comes to research the focus of Professor Boudreau's work on longitudinal studies has been on developing methods for estimating spell durations and the effects of various covariates on these durations, when data are collected through large-scale longitudinal surveys. These methods are extensions of the Cox model and of the Breslow-Aalen estimator that adjust for correlation between observations belonging to the same cluster. Examples of applications include the duration of jobless spells in Statistics Canada's Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics, and the duration of spells without health care insurance and on different social programs in the U.S. Survey of Income and Program Participation. Professor Boudreau has been the leading statistician on various medical research projects on the time to relapse and the time to death following a blood or bone marrow transplant. Such medical procedures rebuild the patient's white blood cells after their destruction by intensive chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment used to kill cancerous cells. The goal of this research is to understand and to estimate, usually by fitting Cox models, the effects of various prognostic factors on these times to events after transplantation.

His work has garnered particular attention in the fields of applied probability, insurance risk/ruin theory, and queueing theory. Professor Drekic's expertise lies in the use of probabilistic/stochastic techniques with advanced computational methods to analyze mathematical problems arising in several different application areas. Education/biography Professor Drekic is a Professor in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo. He received his BA with Honours in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Windsor in 1994. A year later, he received his MSc degree in Statistics from the University of Windsor. In 1999, he completed his dissertation (\"Methods to Reduce Delay in Preemptive Priority Queues\") to earn his PhD in Statistics from the University of Western Ontario. Since joining the University of Waterloo in 2000, Professor Drekic has taught a variety of courses in actuarial science, mathematics, and statistics. In 2015, he was awarded both a Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science Teaching Award and a Faculty of Mathematics Award for Distinction in Teaching. Professor Drekic has been actively involved in the Canadian Operational Research Society (CORS). He took over the editorial duties of the Society's newsletter, the CORS Bulletin, in 1998. He held this position for four years before becoming an executive Councillor in 2002. This was then followed by a nomination to Vice President, and finally, to the position of President which he held in 2005-2006. For his longstanding service to the Society, Professor Drekic was awarded a CORS Service Award in 2007. From 2015-2017, he served as President of the Queueing Theory Special Interest Group of CORS, which was founded in 2011 and has, as its chief mandate, the promotion of the discipline within Canada. In addition, Professor Drekic became an elected member of the International Statistical Institute in 2005 and served as an Associate Editor for the INFORMS Journal on Computing from 2009-2018.

This has resulted in a commensurate demand for tools that allow market participants to analyze and manage their risks effectively. Professor Saunders' research focuses on the application of stochastic optimization and probability, particularly to problems in finance. Professor Saunders' research on the application of stochastic optimization to finance has covered many topics. These include the use of dual variables from optimal portfolio problems for pricing derivative securities; development of an asset-liability management model for complicated insurance products with embedded options and guarantee provisions; the behaviour of optimal credit portfolios in the \"large portfolio\" regime that serves as the foundation for current credit risk regulations; efficient computation of optimal portfolios when returns have a Gaussian mixture distribution; and fast algorithms for portfolio optimization using the Omega performance measure. Recently, Professor Saunders has become interested in problems in credit risk management, as well as the application of analytical techniques to problems in optimal stopping. This has led to work on pricing American options on Levy processes (analysis of the default boundary through integro-differential equations and free boundary problems for integro-differential operators) and inverse default boundary problems (proof of the existence of a default boundary for a given distribution of the time to default, analysis of its small time behaviour, and development of efficient numerical methods for its calculation).

He worked on numerous projects including mutual fund ratings, applications of optimization duality to pricing derivative securities, stochastic programming for risk management, and the development of software for a general system for solving financial stochastic optimization problems (a joint project with the University of Cambridge). After graduation, Professor Saunders was CLR Chair in Corporate Finance and deputy director of RiskLab Cyprus (a financial risk management research laboratory) at the Cyprus International Institute of Management, as well as a research fellow at the HERMES European Center of Excellence on Computational Finance and Economics at the University of Cyprus. He then joined the faculty of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh, where he served as director of the department's Professional Science Masters Program in Mathematical Finance, and supervised numerous collaborative projects between students and financial institutions including RiskMetrics (default boundaries and inverse problems in credit risk), Toronto Dominion Bank (calibration of credit risk models, optimal capital allocation, fast pricing of Bermudan swaptions), PNC Bank (default correlation and CDO pricing, statistical methods for operational risk), and Mellon Bank (mathematical models for operational risk). Professor Saunders has served as a consultant for many financial institutions including the Bank of Nova Scotia (efficient computation of value at risk for Bermudan swaption portfolios), the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (interest rate risk management), the Cyprus Development Bank (credit portfolio management, equity risk management), and the Central Bank of Cyprus (market risk management).

This has led to work on pricing American options on Levy processes (analysis of the default boundary through integro-differential equations and free boundary problems for integro-differential operators) and inverse default boundary problems (proof of the existence of a default boundary for a given distribution of the time to default, analysis of its small time behaviour, and development of efficient numerical methods for its calculation). Education/biography While a graduate student at the University of Toronto, Professor Saunders was an associate member of the Quantitative Research group at Algorithmics Inc., a leading provider of software for financial risk management. He worked on numerous projects including mutual fund ratings, applications of optimization duality to pricing derivative securities, stochastic programming for risk management, and the development of software for a general system for solving financial stochastic optimization problems (a joint project with the University of Cambridge). After graduation, Professor Saunders was CLR Chair in Corporate Finance and deputy director of RiskLab Cyprus (a financial risk management research laboratory) at the Cyprus International Institute of Management, as well as a research fellow at the HERMES European Center of Excellence on Computational Finance and Economics at the University of Cyprus. He then joined the faculty of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh, where he served as director of the department's Professional Science Masters Program in Mathematical Finance, and supervised numerous collaborative projects between students and financial institutions including RiskMetrics (default boundaries and inverse problems in credit risk), Toronto Dominion Bank (calibration of credit risk models, optimal capital allocation, fast pricing of Bermudan swaptions), PNC Bank (default correlation and CDO pricing, statistical methods for operational risk), and Mellon Bank (mathematical models for operational risk). Professor Saunders has served as a consultant for many financial institutions including the Bank of Nova Scotia (efficient computation of value at risk for Bermudan swaption portfolios), the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (interest rate risk management), the Cyprus Development Bank (credit portfolio management, equity risk management), and the Central Bank of Cyprus (market risk management).

Currently I focus on understanding the relation between the random locations (e.g., the location of the path supremum, the hitting times, etc.) and the probabilistic symmetries of stochastic processes/random fields, such as stationarity, self-similarity, exchangeability, etc. I am also working on characterizing these symmetries using various tools including extreme value theory and ergodic theory. More generally, I am enthusiastic about various problems in probability, such as random algebraic topology, limit theorems and financial mathematics. I am also interested in the applications of probability in statistics, physics, econometrics and actuarial science. Education/biography 2013 PhD (Operations Research) Cornell University, U.S.A.

Dynamic treatment regimes are sequences of decision rules that take subject-level data (such as age, health status, or prior treatment) as input and recommend actions (such as which drug to take) as output. Working with longitudinal datasets, my work focuses on deriving methodologies that help identify the sequence of treatment decisions that yields the best expected outcome. More generally, I am interested in identifying new ways to apply methods from different disciplines in new settings. This includes modifying methodology from one area of statistics so that it may be applied in a different area, or through applying statistical methods to novel problems in the 'real world' of data analysis. Education/Biography I received my PhD from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 2012, with my thesis focusing on classical covariate measurement error. Prior to this, I received an MSc in statistics from University College London, and an MA in mathematics from Trinity College Cambridge.

Methods pursued for this type of data include the correlation of different longitudinal outcomes over time using curve-based methods, and incorporating lags and derivatives of the curves. I am also interested in change point and latent response models for longitudinal data, as well as prediction models, including the consideration of similarity to improve prediction accuracy. I work in a variety of application areas, including nephrology, cancer, smoking cessation, intensive care, electronic health records, nutrition, aging, and environmental issues. Education/biography After completing my masters degree in Applied Statistics at Villanova University in 1993, I worked at Veteran Affairs Health Services and Research in Houston, Texas; and at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, also in Houston. I then went on to receive my PhD in Statistics from the University of California at Davis in 2000, after which I worked as an assistant professor at the Yale University Division of Biostatistics, now the Department of Biostatistics, forging several collaborations with researchers in public health and medicine. I arrived as an associate professor at the University of Waterloo in 2005, with a joint appointment in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, and the Department of Health Studies and Gerontology, the latter which is now the School of Public Health Sciences.

Methods pursued for this type of data include the correlation of different longitudinal outcomes over time using curve-based methods, and incorporating lags and derivatives of the curves. I am also interested in change point and latent response models for longitudinal data, as well as prediction models, including the consideration of similarity to improve prediction accuracy. I work in a variety of application areas, including nephrology, cancer, smoking cessation, intensive care, electronic health records, nutrition, aging, and environmental issues. Education/biography After completing my masters degree in Applied Statistics at Villanova University in 1993, I worked at Veteran Affairs Health Services and Research in Houston, Texas; and at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, also in Houston. I then went on to receive my PhD in Statistics from the University of California at Davis in 2000, after which I worked as an assistant professor at the Yale University Division of Biostatistics, now the Department of Biostatistics, forging several collaborations with researchers in public health and medicine. I arrived as an associate professor at the University of Waterloo in 2005, with a joint appointment in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, and the Department of Health Studies and Gerontology, the latter which is now the School of Public Health Sciences.

Methods pursued for this type of data include the correlation of different longitudinal outcomes over time using curve-based methods, and incorporating lags and derivatives of the curves. I am also interested in change point and latent response models for longitudinal data, as well as prediction models, including the consideration of similarity to improve prediction accuracy. I work in a variety of application areas, including nephrology, cancer, smoking cessation, intensive care, electronic health records, nutrition, aging, and environmental issues. Education/biography After completing my masters degree in Applied Statistics at Villanova University in 1993, I worked at Veteran Affairs Health Services and Research in Houston, Texas; and at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, also in Houston. I then went on to receive my PhD in Statistics from the University of California at Davis in 2000, after which I worked as an assistant professor at the Yale University Division of Biostatistics, now the Department of Biostatistics, forging several collaborations with researchers in public health and medicine. I arrived as an associate professor at the University of Waterloo in 2005, with a joint appointment in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, and the Department of Health Studies and Gerontology, the latter which is now the School of Public Health Sciences.

Completed in 1997, with updates in 2000 and 2008. \n \u200bContact Information: Joel Dubin \u200bHealth Data Science Lab (HDSL) Lead: HDSL Website Research interests My primary research interest is in the area of methodological development in longitudinal data analysis, including for multivariate longitudinal data, where more than one outcome, (e.g., systolic and diastolic blood pressure) are each followed for individuals over time. Methods pursued for this type of data include the correlation of different longitudinal outcomes over time using curve-based methods, and incorporating lags and derivatives of the curves. I am also interested in change point and latent response models for longitudinal data, as well as prediction models, including the consideration of similarity to improve prediction accuracy. I work in a variety of application areas, including nephrology, cancer, smoking cessation, intensive care, electronic health records, nutrition, aging, and environmental issues. Education/biography After completing my masters degree in Applied Statistics at Villanova University in 1993, I worked at Veteran Affairs Health Services and Research in Houston, Texas; and at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, also in Houston. I then went on to receive my PhD in Statistics from the University of California at Davis in 2000, after which I worked as an assistant professor at the Yale University Division of Biostatistics, now the Department of Biostatistics, forging several collaborations with researchers in public health and medicine. I arrived as an associate professor at the University of Waterloo in 2005, with a joint appointment in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, and the Department of Health Studies and Gerontology, the latter which is now the School of Public Health Sciences.

These methods can be thought of as deterministic versions of the well-known and highly used Monte Carlo method.

She has also worked on the combination of quasi-Monte Carlo methods with commonly used variance reduction techniques, thereby increasing the ability for these methods to be a substitute for Monte Carlo without losing any advantages. Professor Lemieux's contributions in the field of quasi-Monte Carlo methods have also involved exploring a wide range of settings where Monte Carlo could be replaced by quasi-Monte Carlo. She has done so by looking at applications from different fields (finance, actuarial science, biology, computer vision), and also by considering various types of Monte Carlo approaches (Monte Carlo integration/simulation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, sequential Monte Carlo).

A major goal of Professor Lemieux's research is to improve the applicability of quasi-Monte Carlo methods to a wide variety of practical problems. For instance, some of her work on lattice methods-which provide one way of constructing low-discrepancy point sets-has helped to make these methods more attractive to practitioners by providing explicit constructions shown to work well in practical settings, for instance for high-dimensional finance problems. She has also worked on the combination of quasi-Monte Carlo methods with commonly used variance reduction techniques, thereby increasing the ability for these methods to be a substitute for Monte Carlo without losing any advantages. Professor Lemieux's contributions in the field of quasi-Monte Carlo methods have also involved exploring a wide range of settings where Monte Carlo could be replaced by quasi-Monte Carlo. She has done so by looking at applications from different fields (finance, actuarial science, biology, computer vision), and also by considering various types of Monte Carlo approaches (Monte Carlo integration/simulation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, sequential Monte Carlo). Her current research interests include the construction of new low-discrepancy point sets and sequences designed to work well in practical settings, and the use of quasi-Monte Carlo methods in various risk management problems.

In particular, he focuses on the technical issues entailed in the development of markets for longevity risk transfers, the measurement of uncertainty involved in estimating future mortality, and the demographic and financial risks associated with products such as reverse mortgages. He also works in the area of actuarial applications in law courts.Mortality assumptions are crucial to many areas of actuarial practice. In recent years, people have been living longer than they were expected to, and this has resulted in huge financial losses in annuity and pension portfolios. Thus actuaries are more concerned than ever before with the levels of uncertainty involved in mortality forecasts. Professor Li has developed a range of stochastic methodologies that incorporate factors such as individual differences, trend changes and exogenous interventions. His models have been applied to data sets, and have been proven to give more realistic measures of uncertainty. Securitization is increasingly seen as a solution to the problem of mortality-related risks. In 2010, the Life and Longevity Markets Association (LLMA) was established to promote the development of a liquid traded market in longevity and mortality related risk. Professor Li has studied the technical issues involved in the development of such a market. He has contributed a framework for quantifying population basis risk, the risk arising from the difference between the mortality of the hedger\u2019s population and the population to which the hedging instrument is linked. This work won the Annual Prize for the Best Paper Published in the North American Actuarial Journal in 2011. Professor Li also worked on developing tradable mortality indexes. His paper on parametric mortality index construction has won the 2014 SCOR Actuarial Award in Asia. Professor Li has also investigated a class of contracts called reverse mortgages. In a typical reverse-mortgage contract, the homeowner receives a loan in the form of a lump sum or an annuity. The loan is rolled up with interest until the homeowner dies or moves into long-term care. At that time, the house is sold and the proceeds are used to repay the loan and interest. However, the loan repayment cannot exceed the house sale proceeds. This restriction is called the non-recourse clause or the no-negative-equity-guarantee. A major problem in pricing this guarantee is that the time at which the guarantee is exercised is dependent on the mortality and morbidity of the homeowner. By synthesizing financial engineering techniques and stochastic mortality processes, Professor Li has developed a method to price the guarantee, and to manage the financial and demographic risks associated with the guarantee. Professor Li has strong ties with legal professionals. His collaborative work with the Department of Professional Legal Education at The University of Hong Kong has resulted in two books (published by Sweet and Maxwell Asia, a Division of Thompson Reuters) about the use actuarial methods in personal injury litigation. Education/biography Johnny Li is a Professor of Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo. He holds a Ph.D. degree in Actuarial Science from the University of Waterloo and is a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries (FSA). He also received B.Sc. and M.Phil. degrees from the University of Hong Kong. He is a Co-Editor of the North American Actuarial Journal (2012-present) and was a member of the board of directors of the Asia-Pacific Risk and Insurance Association (2011-2015).

He publishes frequently in journals such as the Journal of Risk and Insurance, Insurance: Mathematics and Economics, the Geneva Paper of Insurance: Issues and Practice, and the North American Actuarial Journal. Professor Li has made significant research contribution to the area of longevity risk. Part of his paper \"Developing Mortality Improvement Formulas: The Canadian Insured Lives Case Study\" is used in the Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA) Guidance Material #210065.

He has contributed a framework for quantifying population basis risk, the risk arising from the difference between the mortality of the hedger\u2019s population and the population to which the hedging instrument is linked. This work won the Annual Prize for the Best Paper Published in the North American Actuarial Journal in 2011. Professor Li also worked on developing tradable mortality indexes. His paper on parametric mortality index construction has won the 2014 SCOR Actuarial Award in Asia. Professor Li has also investigated a class of contracts called reverse mortgages. In a typical reverse-mortgage contract, the homeowner receives a loan in the form of a lump sum or an annuity. The loan is rolled up with interest until the homeowner dies or moves into long-term care. At that time, the house is sold and the proceeds are used to repay the loan and interest. However, the loan repayment cannot exceed the house sale proceeds. This restriction is called the non-recourse clause or the no-negative-equity-guarantee. A major problem in pricing this guarantee is that the time at which the guarantee is exercised is dependent on the mortality and morbidity of the homeowner. By synthesizing financial engineering techniques and stochastic mortality processes, Professor Li has developed a method to price the guarantee, and to manage the financial and demographic risks associated with the guarantee. Professor Li has strong ties with legal professionals. His collaborative work with the Department of Professional Legal Education at The University of Hong Kong has resulted in two books (published by Sweet and Maxwell Asia, a Division of Thompson Reuters) about the use actuarial methods in personal injury litigation. Education/biography Johnny Li is a Professor of Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo. He holds a Ph.D. degree in Actuarial Science from the University of Waterloo and is a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries (FSA). He also received B.Sc. and M.Phil. degrees from the University of Hong Kong. He is a Co-Editor of the North American Actuarial Journal (2012-present) and was a member of the board of directors of the Asia-Pacific Risk and Insurance Association (2011-2015). Professor Li's research interests encompass the fields of stochastic mortality modeling, longevity risk securitization, reverse mortgages, and actuarial applications in law courts. He publishes frequently in journals such as the Journal of Risk and Insurance, Insurance: Mathematics and Economics, the Geneva Paper of Insurance: Issues and Practice, and the North American Actuarial Journal. Professor Li has made significant research contribution to the area of longevity risk. Part of his paper \"Developing Mortality Improvement Formulas: The Canadian Insured Lives Case Study\" is used in the Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA) Guidance Material #210065.

In particular, he focuses on the technical issues entailed in the development of markets for longevity risk transfers, the measurement of uncertainty involved in estimating future mortality, and the demographic and financial risks associated with products such as reverse mortgages. He also works in the area of actuarial applications in law courts.Mortality assumptions are crucial to many areas of actuarial practice. In recent years, people have been living longer than they were expected to, and this has resulted in huge financial losses in annuity and pension portfolios. Thus actuaries are more concerned than ever before with the levels of uncertainty involved in mortality forecasts. Professor Li has developed a range of stochastic methodologies that incorporate factors such as individual differences, trend changes and exogenous interventions. His models have been applied to data sets, and have been proven to give more realistic measures of uncertainty.

I am currently using this approach to combine two marginal models of lizard speciation, and to evaluate the effect of folate intake from different natural sources on the likelihood of colon cancer. Mediation analysis. This type of analysis seeks to understand not only the causal relation between one variable and another, but more specifically, the mechanism through which it occurs. I am interested in formulating realistic modeling assumptions and experimental designs under which this causal mechanism might be convincingly inferred. An application of this work is to determine whether the change in size of lizard species A is due directly to fighting with species B, or merely whether competition for resources indirectly forces species A higher into the trees, where increased size offers a fitness advantage.

Reconstructing past glaciations helps scientists better understand how glaciers have modified the surface of the Earth and its shallow subsurface. This knowledge can be applied to a wide range of problems including mineral exploration under glacial sediment cover, natural hazards, and water resources in glaciated watersheds. Research Interests Applied Quaternary geology (e.g. hydrostratigraphy, drift exploration), 3D geologic modeling and GIS, Glacial geology, sedimentology, sediment geochemistry, shallow geophysics Geohazards: Risks and Prevention Climate Change and Geosciences Protection of Surface and Groundwater Resources Sustainable Water Use and Management Scholarly Research Professor Ross' research is focused on past glacial environments with particular emphasis on glacial sediment-landsystems, landscape evolution of glaciated terrains, and related applications (e.g. drift prospecting and hydrostratigraphy). The general goals are to: advance our understanding of ice sheet dynamics; determine the origin of complex subglacial landform assemblages; establish the net effect of glaciations on sediment dispersion and; establish subsurface sedimentary architecture of glaciated terrains. The approach is multi-faceted, involving the examination of glacial features and sediments in the field or from borehole samples and logs, as well as in the laboratory (e.g. sediment properties and composition, geochronology). He also uses high-resolution shallow geophysics (e.g. seismic, Ground-penetrating radar [GPR]), satellite imagery and digital elevation models, as well as computer geomodeling tools to visualize, analyze and interpret the data in their spatial context. His research group is particularly active in investigating the imprint of palaeo-ice streams, the glacial erosion and dispersal patterns in Arctic Canada, as well as the stratigraphy and hydrostratigraphy of glaciated terrains at various scales from buried valleys to continental sediment cover.

Reconstructing past glaciations helps scientists better understand how glaciers have modified the surface of the Earth and its shallow subsurface. This knowledge can be applied to a wide range of problems including mineral exploration under glacial sediment cover, natural hazards, and water resources in glaciated watersheds.\n\n\nResearch Interests\n Applied Quaternary geology (e.g. hydrostratigraphy, drift exploration), 3D geologic modeling and GIS, Glacial geology, sedimentology, sediment geochemistry, shallow geophysics Geohazards: Risks and Prevention Climate Change and Geosciences Protection of Surface and Groundwater Resources Sustainable Water Use and Management \n Applied Quaternary geology (e.g. hydrostratigraphy, drift exploration), 3D geologic modeling and GIS, Glacial geology, sedimentology, sediment geochemistry, shallow geophysics Geohazards: Risks and Prevention Climate Change and Geosciences Protection of Surface and Groundwater Resources Sustainable Water Use and Management \nApplied Quaternary geology (e.g. hydrostratigraphy, drift exploration),\n3D geologic modeling and GIS,\nGlacial geology, sedimentology, sediment geochemistry, shallow geophysics\nGeohazards: Risks and Prevention\nClimate Change and Geosciences\nProtection of Surface and Groundwater Resources\nSustainable Water Use and Management\nScholarly Research\n Professor Ross' research is focused on past glacial environments with particular emphasis on glacial sediment-landsystems, landscape evolution of glaciated terrains, and related applications (e.g. drift prospecting and hydrostratigraphy). The general goals are to: advance our understanding of ice sheet dynamics; determine the origin of complex subglacial landform assemblages; establish the net effect of glaciations on sediment dispersion and; establish subsurface sedimentary architecture of glaciated terrains. The approach is multi-faceted, involving the examination of glacial features and sediments in the field or from borehole samples and logs, as well as in the laboratory (e.g. sediment properties and composition, geochronology). He also uses high-resolution shallow geophysics (e.g. seismic, Ground-penetrating radar [GPR]), satellite imagery and digital elevation models, as well as computer geomodeling tools to visualize, analyze and interpret the data in their spatial context. His research group is particularly active in investigating the imprint of palaeo-ice streams, the glacial erosion and dispersal patterns in Arctic Canada, as well as the stratigraphy and hydrostratigraphy of glaciated terrains at various scales from buried valleys to continental sediment cover.

Professor Unger also studies the financial and health risks associated with re-developing hazardous waste sites known as \"brownfields\" using alternative clean-up techniques. Professor Unger also studies aspects of signal analysis and spectrogram inversion with specific application to speech recognition and synthesis. Research Interests Computational hydrogeology Water resource supply and infrastructure management, including financial sustainability Signal analysis including speech recognition and synthesis Scholarly Research Financially sustainable water resource supply and infrastructure: Professor Unger's research on this topic focuses on assessing the risk associated with securing the future water supply using groundwater/surface water hydrologic models at the watershed scale. The Province of Ontario has recently issued legislation mandating that all municipalities with a permit to issue water to residents must ensure that their water system is self-financing in order to have their permit renewed. In other words, the fee consumers pay per cubic meter of water consumed must be sufficient to cover all expenses needed to operate and maintain the system in a safe and reliable manner. While this seems like an obvious requirement, it is a fundamental paradigm shift in how municipalities operate. Professor Unger is also investigating project finance strategies to rehabilitate and expand the infrastructure needed to deliver and collect water to and from households given the uncertainty in population growth and the residential/commercial demand for water; the uncertainty in commodity prices consumed during all capital works and O&M activities used to maintain the infrastructure; and the uncertainty in the degradation rate and operable lifespan of the infrastructure. Signal Analysis: Professor Unger's research on this topic focuses on developing numerical algorithms for speech synthesis with human-like emotion, intonation and phrasing. These algorithms represent a mechanistic speech synthesis technology that minimizes the need for machine learning to simply collecting/analyzing/generating context specific information. Key features of this technology involve spectrogram construction and inversion approaches.

His research features thermodynamic modelling that highlight processes operating at the micro scale, such as melting. These processes can have a major impact on large scale tectonics in the continental crust. Research Interests Metamorphic petrology, structural geology and plate tectonics to understand the evolution of the Earth's continental crust Geochronology - the use of stable and radioactive isotopes to date rock formations Orogenesis - the process of mountain formation Climate Change and Geosciences Renewable Energy Energy Materials Next Generation Batteries Threats to Aquatic Ecosystems and their Interaction Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Scholarly Research Professor Yakymchuk's research interests lie broadly in understanding the tectonic histories of mountain belts. He is particularly interested in the differences in orogenic processes from the Archean to present and how these differences are manifested in the rock record. He uses a multidisciplinary approach that applies fieldwork, metamorphic and igneous petrology, structural geology, geochemistry, and geochronology to understand orogenesis and the evolution of the continental crust. He is also interested in fluid\u2013rock interactions in the deep crust and applying the principles of igneous and metamorphic petrology to understand the petrogenesis of mineral deposits.

Through spectroscopy we can learn about the distances, ages, chemical composition and star formation histories of these galaxies. As the light we observe from more distant objects originated at earlier times, by observing ever more distant systems we can reconstruct the changes that occur over time to populations of galaxies. His particular expertise lies in trying to understand the source of the puzzling link between galaxy growth rates and surrounding large-scale structure, many orders of magnitude larger than the galaxies themselves. Research Interests Star Formation in Galaxy Clusters and Groups Stellar Populations in Galaxy Clusters and Groups Properties of the Intracluster Medium Galaxy Formation Astrophysics and Gravitation Scholarly Research Most of the mass in our Universe is made up of dark matter, which interacts only gravitationally. Gravity causes this dark matter to form larger and larger structures as time goes on, leading to a characteristic filamentary distribution of mass that is reflected in the large scale distribution of galaxies today. This structure is the foundation on which galaxies form and evolve; but the growth of galaxies is a much more complex process that involves exchanges of vast amount of energies over large spatial and time scales. Professor Balogh uses the the world's largest telescopes to measure how the mass, age and chemical composition of galaxies changes with time, and how that relates to the surrounding large scale dark matter structure. This requires careful photometric and spectroscopic measurements at optical and near-infrared wavelengths; interpreting the data requires both the development of toy models to identify the driving parameters, as well as detailed comparison with numerical simulations to understand the interplay between competing physical processes.

Teflon\u00ae), new methods of incorporating fluorine into organic scaffolds is of utmost importance. Graham Murphy has recently discovered a new approach to incorporating fluorine and chlorine into organic materials, using hypervalent iodine reagents as halogen transfer agents. This chemistry holds broad appeal to a wide community, and is continuously being expanded to include structural scaffolds of industrial, medicinal and societal importance. Although lithium-ion batteries are the state-of-the-art rechargeable power source for portable electronics, achieving the same level of efficacy in large-scale systems (eg. hybrid electric vehicles) requires fundamental innovation in materials.

His research is focused on the synthesis of nanostructured materials such as porous materials and nano-objects. His main domain of research is using soft matter such as micelles, liquid crystals and biogels, as adaptive soft templates or molds. Eric has developed a specific method for the preparation of mesoporous silica with a good control over the pore size in the range 2 \u2013 9 nm and a narrow pore size distribution. These objects are perfect nanobricks that allow him to build porous bodies where the porosity is created by the assembly of surfactants and the walls by condensation of silica oligomers. His current research in this domain aims to offer a sustainable easily scaled-up industrial process, where organic templates used for the synthesis can be recovered and reused. Eric also develops ceramic membranes for both liquid and gas separation in place of energetic processes (distillation, cryogenic processes). Among the most promising fields are sea water desalination for production of fresh water, hydrogen production for fuel cells, and CO2 recovery from fossil fuel power plants. In another nano research area, Eric specializes in porous matrixes that can be used as molds for the generation of nanoparticles in a confined environment. He uses the dynamics of soft matter to define specific molds that allows him to shape materials synthesised within. Eric is also highly committed to innovation, including teaching, scientific consulting for two startups, and co-founder of two companies, one in biotechnologies (industrial production of microalgae), and one in IT (document search engine).

He develops new synthetic methodology and applies it to the synthesis of novel biomolecules and materials such as modified steroids, carbohydrates, amino acids, peptides, nucleosides, nucleotides and starch nanoparticles. His research program is currently focussed on four key areas: (1) the synthesis and study of cyclic lipodepsipeptide antibiotics; (2) the development of novel phosphorylation chemistry and its application to the synthesis of inhibitors of cytidine triphosphate synthase, an anti-cancer and antiviral target; (3) the development of inhibitors of steroid sulfatase, a breast cancer target and, (4) the modification of starch nanoparticles which are evaluated for their ability to extract oil from oil sands and as novel wound dressings. A wide variety of techniques are employed such as nuclear magnetic resonance, fluorimetry, high-performance liquid chromatography, protein purification, spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic light scattering.

He develops new synthetic methodology and applies it to the synthesis of novel biomolecules and materials such as modified steroids, carbohydrates, amino acids, peptides, nucleosides, nucleotides and starch nanoparticles. His research program is currently focussed on four key areas: (1) the synthesis and study of cyclic lipodepsipeptide antibiotics; (2) the development of novel phosphorylation chemistry and its application to the synthesis of inhibitors of cytidine triphosphate synthase, an anti-cancer and antiviral target; (3) the development of inhibitors of steroid sulfatase, a breast cancer target and, (4) the modification of starch nanoparticles which are evaluated for their ability to extract oil from oil sands and as novel wound dressings. A wide variety of techniques are employed such as nuclear magnetic resonance, fluorimetry, high-performance liquid chromatography, protein purification, spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic light scattering.\n\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n Biological and medicinal chemistry Synthetic methodology Enzymology Bionanomaterials Drug Discovery, Design and Delivery Biomaterials, Polymers and Bioplastics Nanomaterials \n Biological and medicinal chemistry Synthetic methodology Enzymology Bionanomaterials Drug Discovery, Design and Delivery Biomaterials, Polymers and Bioplastics Nanomaterials \nBiological and medicinal chemistry\nSynthetic methodology\nEnzymology\nBionanomaterials\nDrug Discovery, Design and Delivery\nBiomaterials, Polymers and Bioplastics\nNanomaterials\nEducation\n 1991 Ph.D., Chemistry, University of Toronto, Canada 1986 B.Sc., Biochemistry, McGill University, Canada \n 1991 Ph.D., Chemistry, University of Toronto, Canada 1986 B.Sc., Biochemistry, McGill University, Canada \n1991 Ph.D., Chemistry, University of Toronto, Canada\n1986 B.Sc., Biochemistry, McGill University, Canada\nAwards\n 2023 Bernard Belleau Award, Chemical Institute of Canada 2012 and 2017 Outstanding Performance Award 2000 Premiere\u2019s Research Excellence Award 1997 International Union of Pure and Applied Chemists (IUPAC) Travel Award 1992-94 Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Post-Doctoral Fellowship, Dept. of Chemistry, The Pennsylvania State University 1990-91 Ontario Graduate Scholarship, Dept. of Chemistry, University of Toronto 1988-90 Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Post-1988-90 Graduate Scholarship B, Dept. of Chemistry, University of Toronto 1990 Bio-Mega Boehringer Ingelheim Inc.

She is an Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Hydrology, Director of the Collaborative Water Program at the University of Waterloo, elected Member of the Royal Society College of New Scholars, Artists, and Scientists, and an Earth Leadership Fellow. Nandita Basu is internationally renowned in the fields of water sustainability and ecohydrology, where her team has laid critical groundwork to address both fundamental science and applied management questions on nutrient pollution in anthropogenic landscapes. She is an environmental engineer, who uses data science, process modeling and remote sensing to explore how climate, land use, and management impacts surface and groundwater quality across agricultural, urban and forested landscapes, and from watershed to the regional and global scales. Her research leverages these insights to develop watershed management strategies that maximizes environmental benefits without significant economic costs. National and international collaboration has extended the reach and impact of Dr. Basu\u2019s work. She leads a $2.4M Tri-agency project that connects hydrologists, biogeochemists, ecologists and economists with stakeholders across Canada to develop approaches for managing the water quality of lake basins. She co-leads a $1.7M EU Joint Programming Initiative project to expand this work globally, connecting Waterloo with academic experts from Sweden, Denmark and Portugal. Dr. Basu has served on many advisory and technical committees, including the International Joint Commissions\u2019 Science Advisory Board \u2013 Science Priority Committee, established under the Canada-USA Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Research Interests Watershed biogeochemistry and land use change\\tNutrient Legacies and Water quality Watershed Modeling Environmental and ecosystem hydrology Contaminant fate and transport Wetland restoration Food-water-energy nexus Sociohydrology Water resources sustainability Climate Change and Geosciences Managing the Risk of Human Activity in Aquatic Ecosystems Increasingly Complex Water Challenges Protection of Surface and Groundwater Resources Legacies of Agriculture Pollutants Scholarly Research Dr. Basu\u2019s research spans various landscapes and questions - from nutrient pollution in large agroecosystems in North America, to rainwater harvesting and groundwater depletion in India, to forest fires and water treatment, to water conservation in cities, to understanding the role of wetlands and manure management in water quality improvement. Her early research spearheaded a transition in thinking about watershed science from detailed place-based analysis towards the development of regional and global scale theories on watershed functional traits. Later work made fundamental contributions in understanding how buildup of legacy nutrients in agricultural landscapes contribute to time lags in water quality recovery. Her team developed the first ever process-based nutrient-legacy model, Exploration of Long-term Nutrient Trajectories (ELEMeNT), capable of predicting how legacy nitrogen impacts the ability to meet water quality goals. Published in Science, ELEMeNT has already been adopted by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), and the Helmholtz Research Institute (Germany). In the last few years, Dr. Basu has become interested in exploring watershed-scale solutions to water quality challenges. She has developed novel techniques for quantifying the role of wetlands in reducing nutrient pollution, and demonstrated that targeted wetland restoration can remove up to 40x more nitrogen than traditional random restoration approaches \u2013 a major result published in Nature.

His research involves understanding the complex multi-phase flows and transport phenomena that regulate how CO2 behaves in the porous subsurface. Professor Leonenko has a joint appointment with the Department of Geography and Environmental Management. Research Interests Complex multi-phase flows and transport phenomena Geological storage of CO2 and climate control Emerging technologies of petroleum and energy production Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Climate Change and Geosciences Scholarly Research Professor Leonenko focuses on the development of Climate Control technologies with an emphasis on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Industrial scale CO2 storage projects, now operational or in the design phase, provide strong empirical support for the view that CO2 storage can be implemented safely. Nevertheless, significant uncertainties remain regarding the security of underground storage at the scales necessary for this technology to play a significant role in managing global emissions. A critical issue for geological storage is to ensure that the stored CO2 does not escape from the underground formations. Current research interests are in the area of development of new approaches and technologies to mitigate the risks of CO2 leakage (along with other risks) to make CCS more feasible to implement. Modeling and numerical simulation of multiphase flow in porous media, fractures and faults; interactions between CO2 and reservoir fluids; novel technologies for in situ and ex situ dissolution of CO2, and risk assessments are among the topics of Professor Leonenko\u2019s research. He has played significant role in establishing the Carbon Management Canada (CMC) Center of Excellence with $50 million of government funding. He is also actively involved in the development and promotion of Carbon Capture and Storage technologies, including the Shell Sequestration Project and the Wabamun Lake CO2 Sequestration Project (Phase-I, preliminary research). This research has led to more than $1 billion in commercial developments.

Metabolic processes involved in the conversion of biomass to biofuels and bioproducts at elevated temperatures are studied. Novel thermostable enzymes functioning in these processes are identified and characterized. His research provides further understanding of the mechanisms of protein thermostability, unusual metabolic pathways and biocatalysis at high temperatures, and also explores potential applications of these biocatalysts in pharmaceutical and other industrial processes. Hyperthermophiles are a group of microorganisms isolated mainly from deep sea hydrothermal vents and capable of growing at temperatures of \u00b3 90\u00b0C. The majority of hyperthermophiles are classified as Archaea that are considered as the most slowly evolving of all microorganisms. The metabolism at such high temperature (>100\u00b0C) raises many biochemical questions: how are biomolecules stabilized? are there new metabolic pathways and novel metabolites? do these pathways contain unusual enzymes with yet unknown catalytic mechanisms? what is the relationship between structure and function of biomolecules that evolved under extreme conditions? Answering these questions will provide valuable insight into high temperature biochemistry and protein engineering. Novel enzymes are involved in alcohol fermentation at high temperatures, which include both alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate decarboxylase. It is particularly interesting to characterize new types of acetaldehyde-producing enzymes from hyperthermophiles. This research will provide further information required for developing a more efficient system for alcohol fermentation at high temperatures.

Metabolic processes involved in the conversion of biomass to biofuels and bioproducts at elevated temperatures are studied. Novel thermostable enzymes functioning in these processes are identified and characterized. His research provides further understanding of the mechanisms of protein thermostability, unusual metabolic pathways and biocatalysis at high temperatures, and also explores potential applications of these biocatalysts in pharmaceutical and other industrial processes. Hyperthermophiles are a group of microorganisms isolated mainly from deep sea hydrothermal vents and capable of growing at temperatures of \u00b3 90\u00b0C. The majority of hyperthermophiles are classified as Archaea that are considered as the most slowly evolving of all microorganisms. The metabolism at such high temperature (>100\u00b0C) raises many biochemical questions: how are biomolecules stabilized? are there new metabolic pathways and novel metabolites? do these pathways contain unusual enzymes with yet unknown catalytic mechanisms? what is the relationship between structure and function of biomolecules that evolved under extreme conditions? Answering these questions will provide valuable insight into high temperature biochemistry and protein engineering. Novel enzymes are involved in alcohol fermentation at high temperatures, which include both alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate decarboxylase. It is particularly interesting to characterize new types of acetaldehyde-producing enzymes from hyperthermophiles. This research will provide further information required for developing a more efficient system for alcohol fermentation at high temperatures.\n\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n Microbiology Biochemistry and enzymology Protein purification and analysis Metal-containing proteins Microbial physiology Fermentation Molecular biology Hyperthermophiles Biochemistry and Biophysics Bioinformatics, Systematics and Evolution Molecular Genetics Renewable Energy \n Microbiology Biochemistry and enzymology Protein purification and analysis Metal-containing proteins Microbial physiology Fermentation Molecular biology Hyperthermophiles Biochemistry and Biophysics Bioinformatics, Systematics and Evolution Molecular Genetics Renewable Energy \nMicrobiology\nBiochemistry and enzymology\nProtein purification and analysis\nMetal-containing proteins\nMicrobial physiology\nFermentation\nMolecular biology\nHyperthermophiles\nBiochemistry and Biophysics\nBioinformatics, Systematics and Evolution\nMolecular Genetics\nRenewable Energy\nEducation\n 1989 Ph.D. Microbial Biochemistry, Philipps-Universitat Marburg, Germany 1984 M.Sc.

McGuire's research broadly falls in the areas of physiological ecology, movement ecology, thermal biology and ecological energetics. He takes an organismal biology approach, focussing questions at the level of the study animal. As such, natural history is an important part of his research, providing context for both hypotheses and results. McGuire is broadly interested in how animals cope with energetic challenges and how these challenges are driven by environmental conditions and constraints. Bats and birds are great study systems for asking these questions, facing periods of very high energy demands and periods of very low energy availability. His current research focusses primarily on migration and hibernation in bats. As the only two extant groups of flying vertebrates, McGuire is particularly interested in comparisons of bat and bird migration. In some cases he uses bird migration as a better-studied model system, but there are many distinct aspects of bat migration including thermoregulatory strategies, activity periods, and reproductive systems. Research in this area focusses on the implications of heterothermy in migration, seasonal resource limitations, and landscape- and regional-scale movement patterns. Much of this research is related to human wildlife conflict including the problems of bat mortality at wind energy facilities and Hendra virus spillover and migratory bats in Australia. Another major area of current research is hibernation and white-nose syndrome. Across eastern and central North America, millions of bats have been killed by this fungal disease after it was introduced from Europe. McGuire's research program includes several projects looking at the ecology and physiology of hibernation and the pathophysiology of the disease. He is particularly interested in inter- and intra-specific variation in hibernation, including considerations of hibernation at more southern latitudes where winter is shorter and not as harsh as in the north.

The red algae (Rhodophyta) are an ancient lineage with some members being reported in the fossil record as far back as 1.2 billion years. This group is of considerable economic importance since they contain compounds (agar, carrageenan, etc.) that are used extensively as thickeners in products such as yogurt, ice cream and toothpaste. Genera such as Porphyra (aka. Nori, laverbread) and Palmaria (a.k.a. Dulse) are important food sources and are global billion dollar aquaculture industries. In addition, the red algae are a critical group in the evolution of photosynthetic life on earth through secondary endosymbiosis of chloroplasts. This simply means that several lineages currently capable of photosynthesis have gained that ability by engulfing and keeping other photosynthetic organisms inside them. For example, red algae are the common ancestors to the chloroplasts contained in the division, Heterokontophyta (e.g. large kelps common to Atlantic and Pacific coasts). This was a pivotal event in the evolution of photosynthetic life. Despite the obvious importance of this group, very little is known about what are considered \u201cBangiophyte\u201d species. Even more fascinating is that even though the fossil, Bangiomorpha, exhibits the first example of sexual reproduction in the fossil record (1.2 billion years ago), many of these groups do not appear to undergo sexual reproduction or have lost the ability entirely. Dr. M\u00fcller's research focuses on speciation, taxonomy and evolution of sexuality within this enigmatic group and uses molecular techniques to discern if sexual reproduction is or is not occurring within populations. This research will provide a foundation for current genome sequencing projects within the red algae. In addition, she is also interested in the impact and genetics of nuisance algae (e.g. Cladophora and Chara in Laurentian Great Lakes), invasive species (e.g. Bangia atropupurea in the Great Lakes) and their biogeography within problem areas. Dr. M\u00fcller is also studying Cyanobacteria that release toxins and taste and odour compounds in drinking water (Lake Ontario) from a molecular viewpoint in order to determine if particular genotypes present in the water body are contributing to water fouling events.

Balancing basic and applied research, his research group also studies the nitrogen cycle in natural and engineered systems. The Neufeld lab is actively involved in basic and applied research projects that span three complementing research areas: Microbial diversity My lab develops and applies molecular and computational methods to explore complex microbial communities spanning aquatic, terrestrial, and host-associated habitats. Linking function and phylogeny We explore active microorganisms involved in transforming carbon and energy, to better understand who is doing what in the environment. Nitrogen cycle Using a combination of molecular and cultivation approaches, we investigate the microbial community members associated with ammonia oxidation and denitrification.

Other aspects of Dr. Nissimov\u2019s work are the study of the evolutionary relationships of algal viruses with their unicellular hosts and other taxa on the tree of life. The approach that Dr. Nissimov undertakes is multifaceted. It includes laboratory experiments using controlled environment chambers and photo-bioreactors, and studies in the field, where hosts and viruses naturally co-occur. Indeed, Dr. Nissimov has studied microbial interactions and their diversity in the field through work he has done on oceanographic cruises in remote locations in the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans, a sampling campaign in Antarctica, and mesocosm experiments in The Arctic Circle and the fjords of Norway. The main viruses used in Dr. Nissimov\u2019s work are large dsDNA viruses infecting coccolithophores, small ssDNA and ssRNA viruses infecting diatoms, and large dsDNA viruses infecting chlorella. Some of the methods employed in their study and that of their hosts are: quantitative PCR, community fingerprinting and targeted sequencing, plaque and MPN assays, photophysiology and respiration measurements, enzyme activity assays, electron microscopy, analytical flow cytometry, and FlowCam imaging. Current Research Themes in the Nissimov Lab: *Effects of environmental change on aquatic viruses *Algal-virus interactions and co-evolution *Costs and mechanisms of virus resistance in microalgae *Development of new host-virus model systems If you are interested in potential Honours thesis and graduate projects, please contact Dr. Nissimov by email directly (jnissimov@uwaterloo.ca) and include a CV, transcripts, and a brief statement of research interests.

Natural environmental gradients (e.g. geomorphology, hydrology) occur across watersheds that influence water quality, productivity, metabolism, species assemblages and function of ecosystems. Human activities disrupt these natural processes and introduce numerous stressors, including a diversity of contaminants, into the environment. These stressors may act together to cause cumulative effects in watersheds and limit the resiliency and sustainability of ecosystems. The objective of our research program is to build predictive relationships to better model how contaminant exposure leads to effects in fish at various levels of biological organization (from gene expression to populations) and how natural gradients within watersheds modify these responses. We work within a risk assessment framework to define exposure and effects and formulate innovative technologies and solutions to minimize risk to the environment. Research outcomes support the development of more effective risk assessments, monitoring programs and implementation of remedial actions in watersheds. Current research interests include: - Predicting the environmental exposure of emerging contaminants in the environment. - Isolation and identification of chemicals responsible for biological effects. - Enhanced understanding of the mechanistic linkages (Adverse Outcome Pathways) across levels of biological organization leading to effects on fish at the population and community level. - Cumulative effects assessment at the watershed scale. - Development and application of innovative technologies and approaches for risk management and mitigation of stressors (e.g. contaminants, effluents). Professor Mark R. Servos is currently the Canada Research Chair in Water Quality Protection in the Department of Biology. He joined the University of Waterloo as a Professor of Biology in 2003 and served as Scientific Director of the Canadian Water Network until 2011. In 1988, Dr. Servos started as a Research Scientist with the Lakes Research Branch of Environment Canada and later joined the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Great Lakes Laboratory for Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences where he researched environmental fate and effects of contaminants in the Great Lakes. He joined the National Water Research Institute, Environment Canada, in 1996, as Project Chief, and led a group of scientists studying exposure and effects of priority substances. He has helped to organize numerous international meetings/workshops, participated in several expert panels in this field and plays an active role in several major international societies (e.g. Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry). He has published numerous peer reviewed articles on the treatment, exposure, fate and effects of organic contaminants in the environment.

Natural environmental gradients (e.g. geomorphology, hydrology) occur across watersheds that influence water quality, productivity, metabolism, species assemblages and function of ecosystems. Human activities disrupt these natural processes and introduce numerous stressors, including a diversity of contaminants, into the environment. These stressors may act together to cause cumulative effects in watersheds and limit the resiliency and sustainability of ecosystems. The objective of our research program is to build predictive relationships to better model how contaminant exposure leads to effects in fish at various levels of biological organization (from gene expression to populations) and how natural gradients within watersheds modify these responses. We work within a risk assessment framework to define exposure and effects and formulate innovative technologies and solutions to minimize risk to the environment. Research outcomes support the development of more effective risk assessments, monitoring programs and implementation of remedial actions in watersheds. Current research interests include: - Predicting the environmental exposure of emerging contaminants in the environment. - Isolation and identification of chemicals responsible for biological effects. - Enhanced understanding of the mechanistic linkages (Adverse Outcome Pathways) across levels of biological organization leading to effects on fish at the population and community level. - Cumulative effects assessment at the watershed scale. - Development and application of innovative technologies and approaches for risk management and mitigation of stressors (e.g. contaminants, effluents). Professor Mark R. Servos is currently the Canada Research Chair in Water Quality Protection in the Department of Biology. He joined the University of Waterloo as a Professor of Biology in 2003 and served as Scientific Director of the Canadian Water Network until 2011. In 1988, Dr. Servos started as a Research Scientist with the Lakes Research Branch of Environment Canada and later joined the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Great Lakes Laboratory for Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences where he researched environmental fate and effects of contaminants in the Great Lakes. He joined the National Water Research Institute, Environment Canada, in 1996, as Project Chief, and led a group of scientists studying exposure and effects of priority substances. He has helped to organize numerous international meetings/workshops, participated in several expert panels in this field and plays an active role in several major international societies (e.g. Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry). He has published numerous peer reviewed articles on the treatment, exposure, fate and effects of organic contaminants in the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n Ecotoxicology Integrated Water Resources Management Contamination & Remediation: Water, Soil, Air Conservation Ecology and Environmental Biology Managing the Risk of Human Activity in Aquatic Ecosystem Increasingly Complex Water Challenges Protection of Surface and Groundwater Resources Sustainable Water Use and Management Legacies of Agriculture Pollutants Water Security in Mega Cities \n Ecotoxicology Integrated Water Resources Management Contamination & Remediation: Water, Soil, Air Conservation Ecology and Environmental Biology Managing the Risk of Human Activity in Aquatic Ecosystem Increasingly Complex Water Challenges Protection of Surface and Groundwater Resources Sustainable Water Use and Management Legacies of Agriculture Pollutants Water Security in Mega Cities \nEcotoxicology\nIntegrated Water Resources Management\nContamination & Remediation: Water, Soil, Air\nConservation\nEcology and Environmental Biology\nManaging the Risk of Human Activity in Aquatic Ecosystem\nIncreasingly Complex Water Challenges\nProtection of Surface and Groundwater Resources\nSustainable Water Use and Management\nLegacies of Agriculture Pollutants\nWater Security in Mega Cities\nEducation\n 1988 Ph.D. Environmental Chemistry of Pesticides, University of Manitoba, Canada 1983 M.Sc.

A unique and novel aspect of Dr. Craig's research is examining the epigenetic mechanisms driving the altered phenotypes found in teleosts exposed to multiple stressors. Epigenetics is defined by examining the inheritance of variation beyond changes in DNA sequence. Epigenetic regulation, through DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA may profoundly alter transcriptional and translational effects of gene expression, and it is now clear that these mechanisms are influenced by environmental stressors, both natural and anthropogenic, acting as the interface between the genome and the environment. Dr. Craig uses a number of different techniques to address these questions, including next-generation sequencing, qPCR and microarray analysis, cell culture, protein abundance and enzymatic activity, cell respiration and reactive oxygen species production, and measurements of whole animal metabolism and performance. Active research themes in the Craig Lab: *The role of epigenetic regulation on phenotypic responses to environmental stressors in teleosts *Studies here involve the profiling of epigenetic responses (DNA methylation, microRNA) in zebrafish and rainbow trout to environmental stressors and how they dictate the phenotypic response. Transgenerational epigenetic responses to environmental stressors *Studies here examine the heritability of epigenetic mechanism from paternal and maternal sources, both intra- and inter-generationally, in teleosts. Application of epigenetic profiling to local species and conditions *Studies here build upon Themes 1 & 2 and apply epigenetic profiling in local fish species found along the Grand River in effort to predict future responses to emerging organic contaminant threats.

Her mathematical models have been used to predict how and when species become invasive as well as describe the role species play as ecosystem engineers. Her research on the population dynamics of carp, a potentially devastating invasive fish poised to enter the Great Lakes, has grabbed international media attention. Her work also includes studies on the Emerald Ash Borer and the aquatic plant Spartina alterniflora, which alters tidal inundation in coastal regions where it grows. Themes within her research include: Ecosystem engineers: Many important ecological relationships are non-trophic. For example, beavers build dams that determine the hydrology, species composition, and productivity of entire regions. However, almost all ecological theory regarding species interactions and population regulation ignores relations that occur via an abiotic medium. She is engaged in developing and parameterizing models of \u201cecosystem engineers\u201d in an effort to establish the importance of this pervasive phenomena. Invasive species: The prediction of which species will become invasive, and which will which will go extinct is hampered by the failure to recognize the importance the variation of environmental conditions and ecosystem engineering. Positive autocorrelation in factors such as temperature might lead to \u201cruns\u201d of good or bad conditions that determine establishment probabilities and spread rates. Moreover, some species may modify environmental conditions such that their success in increased. For example, the aquatic plant Spartina alterniflora alters current flow, sedimentation rates, and ultimately the tidal inudation height of those coastal regions where it occurs. She develops predictive tools of these phenemona and test them using laboratory populations, and field data. Biological control: Spatial structure in the environment, like the branching morphology of plants, may alter movement, predation, reproductive rates and ultimately, the dynamics, of predator-prey populations. The fundamental mechanism which causes these alterations appears to be the anomalously slow rates of displacement of randomly moving individuals in spatially complex environments. She's testing whether this \"diffusion-limitation\" mechanism occurs in a well-controlled, yet realistic experimental system with biological control implications (peas-aphids-insect predators). The work suggests that Prof. Cuddington and her group can design plants that optimise the ability of beneficial predators to control pests. Philosophy of ecology: Professor Cuddington is interested in the role of metaphor and mathematics in shaping ideas about ecology. She also explores how theories change in the discipline, and what parsimony might mean in the context of ecological theory.

Currently, we are focusing efforts on predicting new families and functions of bacterial flagellins, clostridial toxins, and proteolytic enzymes. *Predicting evolutionary adaptations in genes and genomes: We combine sequence analysis, phylogenetics and structural modeling to pinpoint adaptive events in genes and genomes. We are interested in inferring mechanisms of neofunctionalization and functional divergence in protein families as well as non-coding regulatory elements. *Comparative functional metagenomics: The Doxey Lab is also developing computational approaches to functionally annotate metagenomes and detect biologically relevant differences between them.

In light of these general interests our research currently focuses on the role that conformational plasticity plays in these areas of enzymology and how these dynamic aspects of enzyme structure can be exploited in the regulation of enzyme function. We are currently investigating these phenomena in two enzyme families: 1) the GTP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinases and 2) the IgA1 protease family of bacterial proteases using primarily the tools of steady-state kinetics and x-ray crystallography. Phoshoenolpyruvate Carboxykinases (PEPCK) Our investigations of PEPCK utilize these enzymes as a model system in which to investigate and develop our understanding of the linkage between the conformational plasticity of protein structure and enzyme function and molecular recognition. However, our studies on PEPCK should have additional impacts upon human health as PEPCK is an important cataplerotic enzyme whose activity in humans and other mammals is essential to the maintenance of blood glucose levels. As a consequence, flux through PEPCK contributes to the fasting hyperglycaemia observed in individuals afflicted with either Type I or Type II diabetes and has recently been implicated as a potential player in important biological processes such as cancer and aging. IgA1 proteases In the IgA1 proteases we are interested in discovering the mechanisms by which this enzyme family, containing both serine and metallo-protease isoforms, selectively cleaves a narrow range of protein substrates, primarily human immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1). In particular we are interested in how conformational flexibility plays a role in substrate selectivity and catalytic function in these enzymes. IgA1 proteases are produced in a number of important human bacterial pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the evidence supports a definite role for IgA1 proteases in the pathogenesis of mucosal infection.

In light of these general interests our research currently focuses on the role that conformational plasticity plays in these areas of enzymology and how these dynamic aspects of enzyme structure can be exploited in the regulation of enzyme function. We are currently investigating these phenomena in two enzyme families: 1) the GTP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinases and 2) the IgA1 protease family of bacterial proteases using primarily the tools of steady-state kinetics and x-ray crystallography. Phoshoenolpyruvate Carboxykinases (PEPCK) Our investigations of PEPCK utilize these enzymes as a model system in which to investigate and develop our understanding of the linkage between the conformational plasticity of protein structure and enzyme function and molecular recognition. However, our studies on PEPCK should have additional impacts upon human health as PEPCK is an important cataplerotic enzyme whose activity in humans and other mammals is essential to the maintenance of blood glucose levels. As a consequence, flux through PEPCK contributes to the fasting hyperglycaemia observed in individuals afflicted with either Type I or Type II diabetes and has recently been implicated as a potential player in important biological processes such as cancer and aging. IgA1 proteases In the IgA1 proteases we are interested in discovering the mechanisms by which this enzyme family, containing both serine and metallo-protease isoforms, selectively cleaves a narrow range of protein substrates, primarily human immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1). In particular we are interested in how conformational flexibility plays a role in substrate selectivity and catalytic function in these enzymes. IgA1 proteases are produced in a number of important human bacterial pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the evidence supports a definite role for IgA1 proteases in the pathogenesis of mucosal infection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n Enzymology Structural Biology\\/Macromolecular crystallography Recombinant Protein expression Drug Discovery, Design and Delivery Biochemistry and Biophysics Molecular Genetics Microbiology Bioinformatics, Systematics and Evolution \n Enzymology Structural Biology\\/Macromolecular crystallography Recombinant Protein expression Drug Discovery, Design and Delivery Biochemistry and Biophysics Molecular Genetics Microbiology Bioinformatics, Systematics and Evolution \nEnzymology\nStructural Biology\\/Macromolecular crystallography\nRecombinant Protein expression\nDrug Discovery, Design and Delivery\nBiochemistry and Biophysics\nMolecular Genetics\nMicrobiology\nBioinformatics, Systematics and Evolution\nEducation\n 2000 Ph.D. Biochemistry, University of Notre Dame, United States 1994 B.Sc.
