Methods pursued for this type of data include the correlation of different longitudinal outcomes over time using curve-based methods, and incorporating lags and derivatives of the curves. I am also interested in change point and latent response models for longitudinal data, as well as prediction models, including the consideration of similarity to improve prediction accuracy. I work in a variety of application areas, including nephrology, cancer, smoking cessation, intensive care, electronic health records, nutrition, aging, and environmental issues. Education/biography After completing my masters degree in Applied Statistics at Villanova University in 1993, I worked at Veteran Affairs Health Services and Research in Houston, Texas; and at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, also in Houston. I then went on to receive my PhD in Statistics from the University of California at Davis in 2000, after which I worked as an assistant professor at the Yale University Division of Biostatistics, now the Department of Biostatistics, forging several collaborations with researchers in public health and medicine. I arrived as an associate professor at the University of Waterloo in 2005, with a joint appointment in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, and the Department of Health Studies and Gerontology, the latter which is now the School of Public Health Sciences.

Methods pursued for this type of data include the correlation of different longitudinal outcomes over time using curve-based methods, and incorporating lags and derivatives of the curves. I am also interested in change point and latent response models for longitudinal data, as well as prediction models, including the consideration of similarity to improve prediction accuracy. I work in a variety of application areas, including nephrology, cancer, smoking cessation, intensive care, electronic health records, nutrition, aging, and environmental issues. Education/biography After completing my masters degree in Applied Statistics at Villanova University in 1993, I worked at Veteran Affairs Health Services and Research in Houston, Texas; and at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, also in Houston. I then went on to receive my PhD in Statistics from the University of California at Davis in 2000, after which I worked as an assistant professor at the Yale University Division of Biostatistics, now the Department of Biostatistics, forging several collaborations with researchers in public health and medicine. I arrived as an associate professor at the University of Waterloo in 2005, with a joint appointment in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, and the Department of Health Studies and Gerontology, the latter which is now the School of Public Health Sciences.

Methods pursued for this type of data include the correlation of different longitudinal outcomes over time using curve-based methods, and incorporating lags and derivatives of the curves. I am also interested in change point and latent response models for longitudinal data, as well as prediction models, including the consideration of similarity to improve prediction accuracy. I work in a variety of application areas, including nephrology, cancer, smoking cessation, intensive care, electronic health records, nutrition, aging, and environmental issues. Education/biography After completing my masters degree in Applied Statistics at Villanova University in 1993, I worked at Veteran Affairs Health Services and Research in Houston, Texas; and at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, also in Houston. I then went on to receive my PhD in Statistics from the University of California at Davis in 2000, after which I worked as an assistant professor at the Yale University Division of Biostatistics, now the Department of Biostatistics, forging several collaborations with researchers in public health and medicine. I arrived as an associate professor at the University of Waterloo in 2005, with a joint appointment in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, and the Department of Health Studies and Gerontology, the latter which is now the School of Public Health Sciences.

I am also cross-appointed in the Department of Systems Design Engineering and the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science. My research goal is to design, develop and evaluate technology that can support new ways of interacting with computers and information. A central part of this goal is my interest in providing the ability for richer and faster interaction through the use of one's body, hands, and fingers. The demand for effective interaction is increasing in response to the recent surge in commercial and research hardware that supports the sensing of more and more information about human movement in and around the surfaces ubiquitous in our everyday environment. While this technology has made it possible to interact in interesting and new ways, and even to carry this technology with us everywhere that we go, we have only begun to scratch the surface of what is possible and tend to rely on simple interaction, such as buttons and menus to interact with these new devices. My primary motivation is to harness some of the richness of interaction that is possible with our hands and bodies in how we interact with computers. In my research, I consider the fundamental nature of human movement and perception to help inform the design of interaction for new media.

Janes has research strengths in human-environment interactions, social inequities and health, global health governance, and maternal and child health. From 2005-2008 he examined the impact of recent climate disasters on herding households in rural Mongolia and, with his former doctoral student Oyuntsetseg Chuluundorj, has recently completed a book on this topic. His research with rural herders brought Janes in direct contact with the rapid scale-up of mining activities in Mongolia \u2013 many funded by Canadian investment \u2013 and the impact that these are having on rural communities. Since 2009 he has focused increasingly on assessing the public health impact of global resource extraction, in Mongolia and beyond. He now works mainly at the policy level, specifically on issues related to public health governance of the resource sector. His current projects in this area have focused on bringing health impact assessment concepts and methods into the extractive sector. In recognition of his many years of work in Mongolia, in 2011 he was awarded the \u201cNational Medal of Honour\u201d by the Government of Mongolia for his contributions to developing the health sector, the highest award given to a non-national. In addition to his work on mining and health, Janes has a broad theoretical interest in the association of global social and environmental changes with the emergence and outbreak of infectious zoonotic diseases.

Janes has research strengths in human-environment interactions, social inequities and health, global health governance, and maternal and child health. From 2005-2008 he examined the impact of recent climate disasters on herding households in rural Mongolia and, with his former doctoral student Oyuntsetseg Chuluundorj, has recently completed a book on this topic. His research with rural herders brought Janes in direct contact with the rapid scale-up of mining activities in Mongolia \u2013 many funded by Canadian investment \u2013 and the impact that these are having on rural communities. Since 2009 he has focused increasingly on assessing the public health impact of global resource extraction, in Mongolia and beyond. He now works mainly at the policy level, specifically on issues related to public health governance of the resource sector. His current projects in this area have focused on bringing health impact assessment concepts and methods into the extractive sector. In recognition of his many years of work in Mongolia, in 2011 he was awarded the \u201cNational Medal of Honour\u201d by the Government of Mongolia for his contributions to developing the health sector, the highest award given to a non-national. In addition to his work on mining and health, Janes has a broad theoretical interest in the association of global social and environmental changes with the emergence and outbreak of infectious zoonotic diseases.

My approach to research involves working collaboratively with persons living with dementia, family care partners, providers, organizations, advocacy groups, policy makers and other researchers to identify research questions that are meaningful and to ensure that our findings are shared with a broad array of stakeholders. Specific interests include: long-term care, retirement living, primary care, engaging persons with lived experience, participatory research, and implementation science. \n \u200b\n Graduate supervision and student opportunities\n Graduate supervision and student\n opportunities\n I am currently accepting applications from graduate students with research interests related to: \n Dementia care and/or experiences Culture change Long-term care Retirement living \n Dementia care and/or experiences \n Culture change \n Long-term care \n Retirement living \n Graduate studies application details \n Graduate studies application details\n Teaching interests\n Dementia care Health and community support systems for older adults \n Dementia care \n Health and community support systems for older adults \n Education\n BA Honours Psychology, University of Waterloo \n MA Gerontology, University of Waterloo \n PhD Health Studies and Gerontology, University of Waterloo \n Selected publications \n Selected publications \n See Google Scholar for full list of publications. \n Google Scholar\n Ganann, R., McAiney, C., Johnson, W.

Meyer\u2019s research focus is understanding the complex social and structural factors that shape population health, and the health of vulnerable populations specifically. The notion of trust in government and health policy as it relates to health behaviour is central to her work, as are the concepts mis- and disinformation. Theoretically, she has identified and operationalised semantic distinctions between trust and the related concepts of dependence and obligation that are critical for research investigating and measuring trust. Her empirical research demonstrates the role of trust in the acceptance of health promotion efforts (e.g., risk messaging around alcohol, vaccine uptake, participation in cancer screening programs). Most recently, she has led the development of measures of trust in government and healthcare that will be used in forthcoming intervention research that aims to (re)build trust in the interest of population health. She currently serves on the Executive Committee of the TRuST scholarly network at the University of Waterloo.

Her empirical research demonstrates the role of trust in the acceptance of health promotion efforts (e.g., risk messaging around alcohol, vaccine uptake, participation in cancer screening programs). Most recently, she has led the development of measures of trust in government and healthcare that will be used in forthcoming intervention research that aims to (re)build trust in the interest of population health.

This research has primarily been with people living in northern locations in Canada and more recently with Indigenous organizations located in urban settings. This work has involved dietary assessment with youth, program evaluation, and community development and has, in the past several years, begun to move towards social justice and social policy for improving food security and advocacy for food sovereignty. A second area of research interest is the development of tools to assess knowledge exchange between knowledge producers (e.g. researchers) and knowledge users (e.g. practitioners).

Strategies to build cognitive resilience have the potential to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other causes of cognitive decline, and thus increase the chance of healthy aging for all. \n Graduate supervision and student opportunities\n I am currently accepting applications from graduate students with relevant backgrounds in aging or research methods, and research interests related to: \n Risk factors for Alzheimer\u2019s disease Predictors of healthy aging Trajectories of cognitive decline Cognitive resilience \n Risk factors for Alzheimer\u2019s disease \n Predictors of healthy aging \n Trajectories of cognitive decline \n Cognitive resilience \n Graduate studies application details \n Graduate studies application details\n Teaching interests\n Epidemiologic methods Epidemiology of aging \n Epidemiologic methods \n Epidemiology of aging \n Education\n BSc Human Biology/Biomedical Sciences, University of Guelph \n MSc Pathology, Western University \n PhD Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Western University \nBiostatistics, Western University\n Selected publications \n See Google Scholar for full list of publications.\n Google Scholar\n Faculty , Researchers , Chronic disease prevention and management researcher , Health and aging researcher , Health neuroscience and cognitive epidemiology researcher \n Faculty , Researchers , Chronic disease prevention and management researcher , Health and aging researcher , Health neuroscience and cognitive epidemiology researcher \n Faculty \nFaculty\n Researchers \nResearchers\n Chronic disease prevention and management researcher \nChronic disease prevention and management researcher\n Health and aging researcher \nHealth and aging researcher\n Health neuroscience and cognitive epidemiology researcher \nHealth neuroscience and cognitive epidemiology researcher"}, {"profile": "https://experts.uwaterloo.ca/jim-wallace", "name": "Jim Wallace", "position": "Assistant Professor  Faculty of Health School of Public Health Sciences ", "email": "james.wallace@uwaterloo.ca", "expertise": ["Health informatics", "Human-computer interaction"], "bio": " Associate Professor \n Associate Professor \n Cross appointment with Computer Science Contact information Office: LHN 1716 Phone: 519-888-4567, ext. 40184 Email: james.wallace@uwaterloo.ca Website: Human-Computer Interaction and Health Lab Remote video URL View on YouTube Research interests My research focuses on how we can better enable people to interpret and interact with healthcare data.

Computational methods are required not only to interpret newly sequenced genomes, but search through a vast quantity of existing biological information to reveal previously uncharacterized functionality. The Doxey lab is interested in both the development and application of computational methods to predict novel molecular functions (protein-coding and non-coding) from genomic, structural, and other high-throughput datasets. We explore three separate but overlapping areas: *Predicting novel protein families and functions: We develop methods that combine sequence analysis with structural bioinformatics to predict and experimentally validate protein functions of interest. Currently, we are focusing efforts on predicting new families and functions of bacterial flagellins, clostridial toxins, and proteolytic enzymes. *Predicting evolutionary adaptations in genes and genomes: We combine sequence analysis, phylogenetics and structural modeling to pinpoint adaptive events in genes and genomes. We are interested in inferring mechanisms of neofunctionalization and functional divergence in protein families as well as non-coding regulatory elements. *Comparative functional metagenomics: The Doxey Lab is also developing computational approaches to functionally annotate metagenomes and detect biologically relevant differences between them. Recent work includes the development of the MetAnnotate framework for combined taxonomic and functional profiling of metagenomic datasets.
