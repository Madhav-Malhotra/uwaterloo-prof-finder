She comes from a cross-section of industry and academia in the areas of urban infrastructure, sustainable cities, and sustainable development, in addition to engineering education scholarship and pedagogy. Nadine has taken an interdisciplinary approach to her education and career. Transcending the boundaries of Civil Engineering, she combines environmental engineering, and incorporates non-engineering fields including architecture, economics and governance. Most recently, she was a post-doctoral fellow working on Engineering Education for Sustainable Cities in Africa, launching a \u201cSustainable Cities\u201d course online, and piloting a Global Classroom. She has leverages her industry experience to expand her inquiry into cities through urban and environmental projects in Canada and abroad. In Canada, she worked with municipalities in Southern Ontario on asset management, risk assessment, infrastructure planning, and capital budgeting. Her exposure to municipal engineering leadership and global industry best practices imparts transferable skills that she has excelled at, and applies them in academia to generate and seek collaborative opportunities to bring real world engineering leadership examples into the classroom and with other disciplines interfacing with engineering. Abroad, in the Middle East and North Africa, she worked in international development on high profile and large-scale projects for clients including the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility. In 2010, she received the Early Career Award, in recognition of her work in tackling global challenges in diverse communities in need, and in introducing corporate social responsibility. Her research contributes to a wide spectrum of urban engineering fields and a broad range of global cities, megacities, and most recently megaregions, appearing in leading journals including Nature Climate Change, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. She has been active in futures research on engineering education for the future and co-authored a book chapter \u201cEducating Engineers for the Anthropocene\u201d which appeared in the State of the World 2017: EarthED: Rethinking Education on a Changing Planet, published by the Worldwatch Institute in 2017. She currently chairs a special interest group on the Engineer of 2050 at the Canadian Engineering Education Association (CEEA). For her role as the Turkstra Chair in Urban Engineering, her vision is to build a community of practice of leaders in municipal engineering and academics in urban research to offer leadership towards prospects for our future cities; and to develop urban sustainability literacy among students to motivate their technical specializations and empower them to traverse beyond their disciplines to create liveable futures. Stemming from the University of Waterloo\u2019s \u201cEducating the Engineer of the Future\u201d Nadine\u2019s goals include building partnerships within the department, and with other departments and faculties, and the broader engineering community for the benefit of this urban engineering initiative and advancing engineering education.

His research seeks to address the issues of nonlinearity, multiscale change, and uncertainty in hydrological and water resources forecasting. In this regard, Prof. Quilty has introduced new and computationally efficient information-theoretic methods for nonlinear input variable selection considering uncertainty, developed a set of best practices for wavelet-based forecasting of multiscale processes, and proposed a multiscale stochastic data-driven forecasting framework that accounts for uncertainty in each stage of the forecast design, a particularly useful method for creating ensemble forecast systems that can simultaneously perform ensemble member selection and weighting. He is currently pursuing three research areas that explore: i) new AI, machine learning, and deep learning approaches with a focus on computational efficiency; ii) emerging uncertainty estimation methods (e.g., for input data, input variable selection, parameter, model structure, model output); and iii) coupling physical, conceptual, and data-driven models in addition to auxiliary input sources such as Numerical Weather Predictions, large scale climate indicators, remote sensing, etc. to improve hydrological and water resources forecast accuracy and reliability. An underlying goal of Prof. Quilty\u2019s research program is to create a unified data-driven framework drawing on Big Data to optimize, plan, and manage urban water resources systems (water supply, wastewater, and stormwater systems), and automatically adapt to environmental and policy changes in the face of uncertainty. Prior to joining the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Prof. Quilty worked as a Research Associate at McGill University where he focused on new AI-based methods for hydrological forecasting. At the same time, he worked as a Water Meter Operations Engineer at the City of Ottawa where he focused on: project/program management, developing water consumption forecasting models for the purpose of establishing water, wastewater, and storm water rates, analysis of water consumption profiles for design, operational, and billing concerns, water meter right sizing, and the development of specifications and standards for water supply system components.

Most recently I developed a multiscale stochastic data-driven forecasting framework that addresses each of these issues in holistic manner by integrating artificial intelligence/machine learning methods (e.g. neural networks, random forests, etc.) to model nonlinearities; ii) wavelet transforms to handle multiscale change (i.e. trends, periodicities, transients, etc.); and iii) a stochastic 'blueprint' to account for uncertainties in each stage of the hydrological or water resources model design (i.e., input data, input variable selection, parameters, model output, etc.)., I currently serve as an Associate Editor for Journal of Hydrology and have reviewed manuscripts for over a dozen high-impact journals in the water resources domains and beyond, including: Water Resources Research, Journal of Hydrology, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, Environmental Modeling and Software, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems.

Of particular interest are questions: Does the provision of transit passes provide increased access to recreation, employment and other opportunities? Do students with transit passes experience greater travel independence and, as a result, rely less on chauffeuring by parents and others? If the above holds true, do households experience travel cost savings in terms of both time and money? Application of smart-phones to gather travel behavior in the City of Edmonton Funded by: The City of Edmonton in partnership with R.A. Malatest This research project presents the opportunity to commercialize Ph.D. research conducted at the University of Waterloo. Data \u2013 origin, destination, mode, and path \u2013 were gathered for a large sample of households and travelers in Edmonton to inform the development of a travel forecasting model. The passively collected smart-phone data were used to calibrate and validate information gathered through traditional travel diaries. iCity Urban Informatics for Sustainable Metropolitan Growth Funded by: Ontario Research Foundation (ORF). Grant led by the University of Toronto (Eric Miller) Research aimed at understanding how innovations in travel data collection (both methods and specific information) can better inform decision-making to advance sustainable transportation and cities.Specific questions to be addressed in Waterloo include: How will the investment in Light Rail Transit (LRT) change overall Regional travel patterns? How important will the Region\u2019s Central Transit Corridor (CTC) become for attracting trips? How will travel within the CTC, especially tours, evolve over time as the density and diversity of land uses change? Light Rail and Core Area Intensification \u2013 Unpacking Causal Relationships Funded by: SSHRC (Partnership Development Grant) PI is Dawn Parker, School of Planning Much research has been conducted on the relationship between land use and transportation, particularly the influence of land use investments on density.This research explores these relationships in the Region of Waterloo as a result of the LRT project.This research takes a combined approach to try and demonstrate causality of land use impacts by: Using hedonic pricing techniques to isolate the impacts of proximity to the LRT on land / home values; Interview developers to understand (quantitatively and qualitatively) their perceptions of LRT on market dynamics; Interview home buyers, home sellers, and renters to determine the perceived value of access resulting from LRT. Sustainable Transportation Modeling Funded by: NSERC (Discovery Grant) Research supported significant development of novel data collection and analysis techniques, particularly related to sustain transportation modes \u2013 walking, cycling and transit. Improving transit representation in travel forecasting models Funded by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) The research program develops mathematical methods to represent the dynamic relationship among transit frequency, ridership, and fiscal constraints. The models generated can be used as part of, or in conjunction with, traditional travel forecasting models. The research developed leads to much more robust transit modeling capabilities for regions, cities and transit agencies, allowing governments to invest scarce resources in order to achieve the economic, social and environmental goals associated with greater transit ridership.

Of particular interest are questions: Does the provision of transit passes provide increased access to recreation, employment and other opportunities? Do students with transit passes experience greater travel independence and, as a result, rely less on chauffeuring by parents and others? If the above holds true, do households experience travel cost savings in terms of both time and money? Application of smart-phones to gather travel behavior in the City of Edmonton Funded by: The City of Edmonton in partnership with R.A. Malatest This research project presents the opportunity to commercialize Ph.D. research conducted at the University of Waterloo. Data \u2013 origin, destination, mode, and path \u2013 were gathered for a large sample of households and travelers in Edmonton to inform the development of a travel forecasting model. The passively collected smart-phone data were used to calibrate and validate information gathered through traditional travel diaries. iCity Urban Informatics for Sustainable Metropolitan Growth Funded by: Ontario Research Foundation (ORF). Grant led by the University of Toronto (Eric Miller) Research aimed at understanding how innovations in travel data collection (both methods and specific information) can better inform decision-making to advance sustainable transportation and cities.Specific questions to be addressed in Waterloo include: How will the investment in Light Rail Transit (LRT) change overall Regional travel patterns? How important will the Region\u2019s Central Transit Corridor (CTC) become for attracting trips? How will travel within the CTC, especially tours, evolve over time as the density and diversity of land uses change? Light Rail and Core Area Intensification \u2013 Unpacking Causal Relationships Funded by: SSHRC (Partnership Development Grant) PI is Dawn Parker, School of Planning Much research has been conducted on the relationship between land use and transportation, particularly the influence of land use investments on density.This research explores these relationships in the Region of Waterloo as a result of the LRT project.This research takes a combined approach to try and demonstrate causality of land use impacts by: Using hedonic pricing techniques to isolate the impacts of proximity to the LRT on land / home values; Interview developers to understand (quantitatively and qualitatively) their perceptions of LRT on market dynamics; Interview home buyers, home sellers, and renters to determine the perceived value of access resulting from LRT. Sustainable Transportation Modeling Funded by: NSERC (Discovery Grant) Research supported significant development of novel data collection and analysis techniques, particularly related to sustain transportation modes \u2013 walking, cycling and transit. Improving transit representation in travel forecasting models Funded by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) The research program develops mathematical methods to represent the dynamic relationship among transit frequency, ridership, and fiscal constraints. The models generated can be used as part of, or in conjunction with, traditional travel forecasting models. The research developed leads to much more robust transit modeling capabilities for regions, cities and transit agencies, allowing governments to invest scarce resources in order to achieve the economic, social and environmental goals associated with greater transit ridership.

Of particular interest are questions: Does the provision of transit passes provide increased access to recreation, employment and other opportunities? Do students with transit passes experience greater travel independence and, as a result, rely less on chauffeuring by parents and others? If the above holds true, do households experience travel cost savings in terms of both time and money? Application of smart-phones to gather travel behavior in the City of Edmonton Funded by: The City of Edmonton in partnership with R.A. Malatest This research project presents the opportunity to commercialize Ph.D. research conducted at the University of Waterloo. Data \u2013 origin, destination, mode, and path \u2013 were gathered for a large sample of households and travelers in Edmonton to inform the development of a travel forecasting model. The passively collected smart-phone data were used to calibrate and validate information gathered through traditional travel diaries. iCity Urban Informatics for Sustainable Metropolitan Growth Funded by: Ontario Research Foundation (ORF). Grant led by the University of Toronto (Eric Miller) Research aimed at understanding how innovations in travel data collection (both methods and specific information) can better inform decision-making to advance sustainable transportation and cities.Specific questions to be addressed in Waterloo include: How will the investment in Light Rail Transit (LRT) change overall Regional travel patterns? How important will the Region\u2019s Central Transit Corridor (CTC) become for attracting trips? How will travel within the CTC, especially tours, evolve over time as the density and diversity of land uses change? Light Rail and Core Area Intensification \u2013 Unpacking Causal Relationships Funded by: SSHRC (Partnership Development Grant) PI is Dawn Parker, School of Planning Much research has been conducted on the relationship between land use and transportation, particularly the influence of land use investments on density.This research explores these relationships in the Region of Waterloo as a result of the LRT project.This research takes a combined approach to try and demonstrate causality of land use impacts by: Using hedonic pricing techniques to isolate the impacts of proximity to the LRT on land / home values; Interview developers to understand (quantitatively and qualitatively) their perceptions of LRT on market dynamics; Interview home buyers, home sellers, and renters to determine the perceived value of access resulting from LRT. Sustainable Transportation Modeling Funded by: NSERC (Discovery Grant) Research supported significant development of novel data collection and analysis techniques, particularly related to sustain transportation modes \u2013 walking, cycling and transit. Improving transit representation in travel forecasting models Funded by: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) The research program develops mathematical methods to represent the dynamic relationship among transit frequency, ridership, and fiscal constraints. The models generated can be used as part of, or in conjunction with, traditional travel forecasting models. The research developed leads to much more robust transit modeling capabilities for regions, cities and transit agencies, allowing governments to invest scarce resources in order to achieve the economic, social and environmental goals associated with greater transit ridership.

She focuses on sustainable technology development and deployment, integrated resource management, climate change adaptation, and the protection of public health. Professor Emelko\u2019s research is currently funded by many organizations including the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), the Water Research Foundation, and Alberta Innovates as well as several industry and government partners. She co-leads the Southern Rockies Watershed Project team, which evaluates the initial effects of natural disturbance by wildfire on hydrology, water quality, and aquatic ecology; and monitors the recovery of these values in front range headwater streams of the high water yielding eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Professor Emelko's team was among the first cited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for identifying climate change-associated threats from wildfire to drinking water security through water quality and treatability. Her ongoing work involves active participation from over 3 dozen utilities and conservation authorities across Canada and the United States. Professor Emelko has served as a technical advisor to the U.S. National Academies of Engineering, Science, and Medicine as well as several federal and provincial/state agencies in Canada, the United States, and Australia regarding regulatory development related to drinking water treatment, source water protection, public health policy, and integrated resource management.

She focuses on sustainable technology development and deployment, integrated resource management, climate change adaptation, and the protection of public health. Professor Emelko\u2019s research is currently funded by many organizations including the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), the Water Research Foundation, and Alberta Innovates as well as several industry and government partners. She co-leads the Southern Rockies Watershed Project team, which evaluates the initial effects of natural disturbance by wildfire on hydrology, water quality, and aquatic ecology; and monitors the recovery of these values in front range headwater streams of the high water yielding eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Professor Emelko's team was among the first cited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for identifying climate change-associated threats from wildfire to drinking water security through water quality and treatability. Her ongoing work involves active participation from over 3 dozen utilities and conservation authorities across Canada and the United States. Professor Emelko has served as a technical advisor to the U.S. National Academies of Engineering, Science, and Medicine as well as several federal and provincial/state agencies in Canada, the United States, and Australia regarding regulatory development related to drinking water treatment, source water protection, public health policy, and integrated resource management.\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\nCanada Research Chair in Water Science, Technology & Policy\nWater Science, Technology & Policy Group\n\nNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council\n\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\nResearch Interests\n Water treatment, Wildfire, Water quality, Pathogens, Climate change, Filtration, Land disturbance, Environmental & Water Resources, Water and Land Management, Nanoparticle Removal during Drinking Water and Wastewater Treatment, Quanititative Microbial Risk Assessment, Water Protection, Smart Infrastructure \n Water treatment, Wildfire, Water quality, Pathogens, Climate change, Filtration, Land disturbance, Environmental & Water Resources, Water and Land Management, Nanoparticle Removal during Drinking Water and Wastewater Treatment, Quanititative Microbial Risk Assessment, Water Protection, Smart Infrastructure \nWater treatment, Wildfire, Water quality, Pathogens, Climate change, Filtration, Land disturbance, Environmental & Water Resources, Water and Land Management, Nanoparticle Removal during Drinking Water and Wastewater Treatment, Quanititative Microbial Risk Assessment, Water Protection, Smart Infrastructure\nEducation\n 2001, Doctorate Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada 1995, Master's Civil Engineering, UCLA, USA 1994, Bachelor's Environmental Engineering Science, MIT, USA 1993, Bachelor's Chemical Engineering, MIT, USA \n 2001, Doctorate Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada 1995, Master's Civil Engineering, UCLA, USA 1994, Bachelor's Environmental Engineering Science, MIT, USA 1993, Bachelor's Chemical Engineering, MIT, USA \n2001, Doctorate Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada\n1995, Master's Civil Engineering, UCLA, USA\n1994, Bachelor's Environmental Engineering Science, MIT, USA\n1993, Bachelor's Chemical Engineering, MIT, USA\nAwards\n 1997 Sir Sandford Fleming Foundation Teaching Assistantship Award, University of Waterloo 1997 OWWA/OMWA Annual Conference - Best Presentation Award 1999 U.S. NSF Program for the Retention of Engineering Educators (Invited) 2002 AWWA Academic Achievement Award (2nd place) for best doctoral dissertation in N.

Professor Al-Mayah\u2019s expertise spans from materials, mechanics and structural applications to biomechanics, imaging and medical physics. His research in materials is centered on the integration of imaging and mechanics for material characterization, which will target the mechanical properties of engineering materials using a new approach that merges imaging, mechanics and numerical modeling. This innovative approach will shift the mechanical characterization of materials from the conventional \u201coverall\u201d performance to a \u201ccomponents-based\u201d evaluation. It will also transfer conventional visual image inspection to a detailed image-based mechanical analysis with stress distribution, and deformation to identify failure initiation and the role of each component on the load carrying capacity. In mechanics and structural applications, a comprehensive research program on the interfacial mechanics of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) has resulted in the design of a gripping system known as FibreLokTM that enables structural engineers to utilize full high tensile strength of FRP rods. Professor Al-Mayah is also conducting research on biomechanical properties of soft tissues and medical applications. The research focuses on the development of new minimally invasive techniques to measure in vivo, and patient-specific mechanical properties of tissues. In addition, he has applied biomechanical modeling for image guided radiotherapy of the lungs, head-and-neck, liver, prostate, and breast.

Annable is an Associate Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Waterloo. He is affiliated with Professional Engineers of Ontario, the Association of Professional Geoscientist of Ontario, the American Geophysical Union, the Geological Society of America, and the International Association of Hydrogeologists. He has been researching the hydraulic, sediment transport and morphological characteristics of rivers for over the past 18 years. In addition, he has been designing, monitoring and supervising the construction of natural channel restoration projects throughout North America - totalling over 2,500km of streams and rivers studied and over 180km of restored river channels. Professor Annable\u2019s recent research has focused on the sediment transport characteristics of urban river systems and how changes in hydrology affect habitat dynamics. He is specifically interested in river restoration, rehabilitation and aquatic habitat improvements. The study of basin scale isotope hydrology and sediment transport of non-point source contaminants, along with conducting numerical and field studies of groundwater surface water interaction and karst hydrology are other interests of his as well. Additionally, Professor Annable conducts field and numerical modelling studies on urban river mechanics, hydraulics and hydrology. His current sources of research funding are from NSERC, CFI, EPA, Water Districts, Municipalities, and DFO.\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering\nProfessional Engineers of Ontario\nAssociation of Professional Geoscientist of Ontario\nAmerican Geophysical Union\nGeological Society of America\nInternational Association of Hydrogeologists\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n River Hydraulics and Sediment Transport, River Restoration, Flood Management, Ecohydraulics, Karst Hydrology, Environmental monitoring \n River Hydraulics and Sediment Transport, River Restoration, Flood Management, Ecohydraulics, Karst Hydrology, Environmental monitoring \nRiver Hydraulics and Sediment Transport, River Restoration, Flood Management, Ecohydraulics, Karst Hydrology, Environmental monitoring\nScholarly Research\n Collaborator with Environment Canada in the development of new techniques for water and sediment discharge and the integration of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional models.

She is an Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Hydrology, Director of the Collaborative Water Program at the University of Waterloo, elected Member of the Royal Society College of New Scholars, Artists, and Scientists, and an Earth Leadership Fellow. Nandita Basu is internationally renowned in the fields of water sustainability and ecohydrology, where her team has laid critical groundwork to address both fundamental science and applied management questions on nutrient pollution in anthropogenic landscapes. She is an environmental engineer, who uses data science, process modeling and remote sensing to explore how climate, land use, and management impacts surface and groundwater quality across agricultural, urban and forested landscapes, and from watershed to the regional and global scales. Her research leverages these insights to develop watershed management strategies that maximizes environmental benefits without significant economic costs. National and international collaboration has extended the reach and impact of Dr. Basu\u2019s work. She leads a $2.4M Tri-agency project that connects hydrologists, biogeochemists, ecologists and economists with stakeholders across Canada to develop approaches for managing the water quality of lake basins. She co-leads a $1.7M EU Joint Programming Initiative project to expand this work globally, connecting Waterloo with academic experts from Sweden, Denmark and Portugal. Dr. Basu has served on many advisory and technical committees, including the International Joint Commissions\u2019 Science Advisory Board \u2013 Science Priority Committee, established under the Canada-USA Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Research Interests Watershed biogeochemistry and land use change\\tNutrient Legacies and Water quality Watershed Modeling Environmental and ecosystem hydrology Contaminant fate and transport Wetland restoration Food-water-energy nexus Sociohydrology Water resources sustainability Climate Change and Geosciences Managing the Risk of Human Activity in Aquatic Ecosystems Increasingly Complex Water Challenges Protection of Surface and Groundwater Resources Legacies of Agriculture Pollutants Scholarly Research Dr. Basu\u2019s research spans various landscapes and questions - from nutrient pollution in large agroecosystems in North America, to rainwater harvesting and groundwater depletion in India, to forest fires and water treatment, to water conservation in cities, to understanding the role of wetlands and manure management in water quality improvement. Her early research spearheaded a transition in thinking about watershed science from detailed place-based analysis towards the development of regional and global scale theories on watershed functional traits. Later work made fundamental contributions in understanding how buildup of legacy nutrients in agricultural landscapes contribute to time lags in water quality recovery. Her team developed the first ever process-based nutrient-legacy model, Exploration of Long-term Nutrient Trajectories (ELEMeNT), capable of predicting how legacy nitrogen impacts the ability to meet water quality goals. Published in Science, ELEMeNT has already been adopted by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), and the Helmholtz Research Institute (Germany). In the last few years, Dr. Basu has become interested in exploring watershed-scale solutions to water quality challenges. She has developed novel techniques for quantifying the role of wetlands in reducing nutrient pollution, and demonstrated that targeted wetland restoration can remove up to 40x more nitrogen than traditional random restoration approaches \u2013 a major result published in Nature.

Wayne Brodland is a Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Waterloo. His research interests lie in mechanics and finite element modelling of embryo development, studying the mechanical causes of malformation birth defects, testing tissue mechanics, and observing the three-dimensional reconstruction of cells, tissues and embryos. Specifically speaking, Professor Brodland studies the mechanics of cell and tissue morphogenesis - the physical forces that drive self-organization of cells, tissues and, ultimately, whole organisms. These processes are important in embryogenesis, regenerative medicine and cancer metastases. Professor Brodland and his team use experiments and computational models to investigate these forces, and have developed advanced computer software and custom test instruments to aid them with their research. His current sources of research funding are from The Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP), Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and Ontario Centres of Excellence (OCE).

Burn is a Professor in the Civil and Environmental Engineering department, as well as a member of the Environmental and Water Resources Engineering Research Group and the Water Institute. He was a member of the Study Board for the International Joint Commission\u2019s International Upper Great Lakes Study and was previously a co-editor of the Canadian Water Resources Journal. \nCivil and Environmental Engineering\nWater Institute\nInternational Joint Commission\u2019s International Upper Great Lakes Study\nProfessor Burn conducts research that deals with statistical aspects of hydrology. The primary focus of this work is in regional frequency analysis, in which he has developed approaches for identifying and forming groups of catchments that have been used elsewhere in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. \nProfessor Burn also investigates approaches for characterizing drought probabilities in large drainage basins using stream flow generation techniques. He investigates the hydrologic implications of climatic change, and develops methods for extending short hydrologic data records. He also investigates issues related to the design of data collection networks and develops approaches for rationalizing data collection activities. The use of emerging technologies for solving water resource problems has led to research investigating the use of neural networks for developing improved approaches for short term stream flow forecasting. Professor Burn uses systems analysis techniques to address problems related to water quality management and reservoir operation.\nResearch interests\n Hydrological extremes Regional analysis Frequency analysis Hydrological variability Risk Quantile estimation Bivariate analysis Hydrology Climate change Environmental & Water Resources Water \nHydrological extremes\nRegional analysis\nFrequency analysis\nHydrological variability\nRisk\nQuantile estimation\nBivariate analysis\nHydrology\nClimate change\nEnvironmental & Water Resources\nWater\nEducation\n 1985, Doctorate, Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo 1982, Master of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo 1981, Master of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo \n 1985, Doctorate, Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo \n 1982, Master of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo \n 1981, Master of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo \nSelected/recent publications\n O'Brien NL, DH Burn, WK Annable, PJ Thompson, Trend Detection in the Presence of Positive and Negative Serial Correlation: A Comparison of Block Maxima and Peaks-over-Threshold Data, Water Resources Research, Accepted: March, 2021, 28p.

His expertise lies in the conversion of near infra-red light directly to visible light, design and fabrication of high-performance quantum devices and the development of ultra-sensitive surface plasmon sensors. Professor Ban successfully improved the efficiency of hybrid organic/inorganic devices by more than one order of magnitude and applied time-domain terahertz spectroscopy to study the device physics of terahertz quantum cascade lasers. Professor Ban\u2019s research has also accomplished the fabrication of prototype hybrid organic/inorganic devices by direct tandem integration and the study of the effects of interfacial states on device performance. These devices are responsible for the conversion of near-infrared light directly to visible light (green) at room temperature. Professor Ban pioneered the development of new methods in scanning probe microscopy to observe, with nanometric spatial resolution, two-dimensional profiles of conductivity and potential inside actively-driven lasers. He also resolved the nanoscopic reason for anomalously high series resistance encountered in ridge waveguide lasers. In addition, Professor Ban reported the first direct experimental observation of electron overbarrier leakage in operating buried heterostructure multi-quantum-well \u2013lasers. His work has provided the first experimental visualization of the inner workings of operating semiconductor lasers, and has also provided a platform for enabling tools for quantum semiconductor device and nanotechnology research.

His expertise lies in the conversion of near infra-red light directly to visible light, design and fabrication of high-performance quantum devices and the development of ultra-sensitive surface plasmon sensors. Professor Ban successfully improved the efficiency of hybrid organic/inorganic devices by more than one order of magnitude and applied time-domain terahertz spectroscopy to study the device physics of terahertz quantum cascade lasers. Professor Ban\u2019s research has also accomplished the fabrication of prototype hybrid organic/inorganic devices by direct tandem integration and the study of the effects of interfacial states on device performance. These devices are responsible for the conversion of near-infrared light directly to visible light (green) at room temperature. Professor Ban pioneered the development of new methods in scanning probe microscopy to observe, with nanometric spatial resolution, two-dimensional profiles of conductivity and potential inside actively-driven lasers. He also resolved the nanoscopic reason for anomalously high series resistance encountered in ridge waveguide lasers. In addition, Professor Ban reported the first direct experimental observation of electron overbarrier leakage in operating buried heterostructure multi-quantum-well \u2013lasers. His work has provided the first experimental visualization of the inner workings of operating semiconductor lasers, and has also provided a platform for enabling tools for quantum semiconductor device and nanotechnology research.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n Semiconductor quantum devices, Photonics, THz technology, Nanotechnology, Atomic force microscope, Fiber-optical communication system, Silicon Devices, Terahertz Quantum Cascade Lasers, Biophotonics, Scanning Probe Microscopy, Connectivity and Internet of Things, Nanofabrication, IoT, Devices, Application domains \n Semiconductor quantum devices, Photonics, THz technology, Nanotechnology, Atomic force microscope, Fiber-optical communication system, Silicon Devices, Terahertz Quantum Cascade Lasers, Biophotonics, Scanning Probe Microscopy, Connectivity and Internet of Things, Nanofabrication, IoT, Devices, Application domains \nSemiconductor quantum devices, Photonics, THz technology, Nanotechnology, Atomic force microscope, Fiber-optical communication system, Silicon Devices, Terahertz Quantum Cascade Lasers, Biophotonics, Scanning Probe Microscopy, Connectivity and Internet of Things, Nanofabrication, IoT, Devices, Application domains\nEducation\n 2003, Doctorate PhD, University of Toronto, Ontario 1995, Master's MS, University of Science and Technology of China, China 1993, Bachelor's BA, University of Science and Technology of China, China \n 2003, Doctorate PhD, University of Toronto, Ontario 1995, Master's MS, University of Science and Technology of China, China 1993, Bachelor's BA, University of Science and Technology of China, China \n2003, Doctorate PhD, University of Toronto, Ontario\n1995, Master's MS, University of Science and Technology of China, China\n1993, Bachelor's BA, University of Science and Technology of China, China\nTeaching*\n ECE 672 -

I also have research interests in the field of parallel and distributed systems as well as the field of engineering education. \nIndustrial Research\n As a senior co-op student, I was employed for 8 months in 1992 and 1993 by Atlantis Aerospace to work on several large software development projects. At Atlantis Aerospace, I developed the core simulation engine for their A320 Airbus flight training devices and their Boeing 747 flight training devices. I was also involved in the development of graphics algorithms for the display units., Prior to working at Atlantis Aerospace, I was employed for 8 months in 1992 and 1991 by Motorola Corporation to work on software for their dispatch systems. I developed code to implement new features and correct bugs in existing features. I was also involved in the port of their product from a VAX VMS platform to an IBM OS/2 platform. \nEducation\n 2003, Doctorate Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada 1996, Master of Applied Science Electrical Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada 1994, Bachelor of Applied Science Computer Engineering / Management Science Option, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada \n 2003, Doctorate Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada 1996, Master of Applied Science Electrical Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada 1994, Bachelor of Applied Science Computer Engineering / Management Science Option, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada \n2003, Doctorate Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada\n1996, Master of Applied Science Electrical Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada\n1994, Bachelor of Applied Science Computer Engineering / Management Science Option, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada\nAwards\n 2006, James A.

Due to their long-chain structure, polymers are highly flexible and can be readily filled with components such as nanoparticles and nanowires, enabling many innovative applications (e.g. flexible electronics, smart windows and soft robotic fingers). \nOne particular interest is in the adhesion phenomena at the micro and nano scales. Effective adhesion between similar or dissimilar material components has become one of the most critical prerequisites for advanced manufacturing at ever-smaller scales. As a result, Professor Zhao concentrates on the optimization of polymer adhesive materials. \nProfessor Zhao studies biomimicry, which involves biological systems such as lotus leaves, gecko adhesive pads, mussel adhesive plaque and biofilms. He has been studying reversible adhesive properties of gecko footpads. He has conducted theoretical and experimental investigation into the adhesion and friction forces that characterize the gecko\u2019s foot hairs and developed a Johnson-Kendall-Roberts friction model to interpret the dynamic behaviour. This biomimetic research has applications in biomedicine, as the adhesive can be used as an alternative to stitches, as well as a reconstructive material to reduce scarring when treating burn and cancer patients. \nProfessor Zhao develops advanced polymer composites and coatings as self-cleaning surfaces. One development is a superhydrophobic self-cleaning surface that can prevent the deposition and adhesion of liquid droplets. This includes the tiny respiratory droplets, expelled when talking and sneezing, that might contain infectious virus. Another development is antimicrobial coatings that can actively kill bacterial, fungi and virus.\nResearch interests\n Surface science and bionanomaterials Adhesives and coatings Biomimetic micro and nano fabrication Nanotechnology Biomechanics Biolubrication Polymer Science Hydrogels Interfacial Phenomena Colloids & Porous Media Micro- and nano-tribology Bionanomaterials Soft Interfaces Biomimetic Adhesion Bio-integrated Devices Nanoparticles synthesis Interfacial materials engineering Biomimicry Biomimetic materials and devices Multifunctional polymers and nanocomposites Biopolymer and healthcare materials Advanced coating and adhesive bonding technology Additive Manufacturing Nanotechnology Nanotechnology, Soft Materials and Interface Polymers and soft robotics \nSurface science and bionanomaterials\nAdhesives and coatings\nBiomimetic micro and nano fabrication\nNanotechnology\nBiomechanics\nBiolubrication\nPolymer Science\nHydrogels\nInterfacial Phenomena\nColloids & Porous Media\nMicro- and nano-tribology\nBionanomaterials\nSoft Interfaces\nBiomimetic Adhesion\nBio-integrated Devices\nNanoparticles synthesis\nInterfacial materials engineering\nBiomimicry\nBiomimetic materials and devices\nMultifunctional polymers and nanocomposites\nBiopolymer and healthcare materials\nAdvanced coating and adhesive bonding technology\nAdditive Manufacturing\nNanotechnology\nNanotechnology, Soft Materials and Interface\nPolymers and soft robotics\nEducation\n 2004, Doctorate, Chemical Engineering, McMaster University 1999, Master's, Institute of Chemical Metallurgy, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 1996, Bachelor's, Mineral Engineering, Central South University \n 2004, Doctorate, Chemical Engineering, McMaster University \n 1999, Master's, Institute of Chemical Metallurgy, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing \n 1996, Bachelor's, Mineral Engineering, Central South University \nCourses*\n CHE 100 -

His research projects have investigated topics including: fatigue assessment and retrofitting of welded metal structures, encouraging the use of lighter, more corrosion resistant materials in new construction, and the development of new connection concepts to enable modular construction and reduce the costs associated with deconstruction and adaptive reuse. His research employs a broad range of tools, including laboratory testing, fracture mechanics, structural reliability theory, and life-cycle cost analysis. Currently, Scott is active on a number of CSA design code committees. In particular, he is chairing the aluminum structures technical subcommittee of the Canadian bridge design code (S6), as well as serving actively on the S6 technical subcommittee for steel structures, and the technical committees for the structural steel and aluminum welding codes (W59 and W59.2) and the aluminum structures design code (S157). In recent years he has served on the editorial boards for the IABSE journal: Structural Engineering International and the ASCE Journal of Bridge Engineering. Scott served as Program Director for Waterloo\u2019s Architectural Engineering undergraduate program from 2018-2022. \n\n\nResearch Interests\n Fatigue assessment Fatigue retrofitting Welded metal structures Aluminum Structures Steel Structures Modular construction Design for deconstruction Structural testing Fracture mechanics Structural reliability analysis Life-cycle cost analysis \n Fatigue assessment Fatigue retrofitting Welded metal structures Aluminum Structures Steel Structures Modular construction Design for deconstruction Structural testing Fracture mechanics Structural reliability analysis Life-cycle cost analysis \nFatigue assessment\nFatigue retrofitting\nWelded metal structures\nAluminum Structures\nSteel Structures\nModular construction\nDesign for deconstruction\nStructural testing\nFracture mechanics\nStructural reliability analysis\nLife-cycle cost analysis\nEducation\n 2005, Doctorate Civil Engineering, Steel Structures Laboratory (ICOM) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland 1998, Master's Structural Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada 1996, Bachelor's Civil Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada \n 2005, Doctorate Civil Engineering, Steel Structures Laboratory (ICOM) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland 1998, Master's Structural Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada 1996, Bachelor's Civil Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada \n2005, Doctorate Civil Engineering, Steel Structures Laboratory (ICOM) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland\n1998, Master's Structural Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada\n1996, Bachelor's Civil Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada\nTeaching*\n AE 200 - Enclosure Design Studio Taught in 2022 AE 265 - Structure and Properties of Materials Taught in 2020, 2021, 2022 AE 325 - Project 1 Studio Taught in 2022 CIVE 265 - Structure and Properties of Materials Taught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 CIVE 512 - Rehabilitation of Structures Taught in 2020, 2021, 2023 CIVE 701 - Topics in Mechanics Taught in 2022 * Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed. \n AE 200 - Enclosure Design Studio Taught in 2022 AE 265 - Structure and Properties of Materials Taught in 2020, 2021, 2022 AE 325 - Project 1 Studio Taught in 2022 CIVE 265 - Structure and Properties of Materials Taught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 CIVE 512 - Rehabilitation of Structures Taught in 2020, 2021, 2023 CIVE 701 - Topics in Mechanics Taught in 2022 \nAE 200 - Enclosure Design Studio Taught in 2022 \n Taught in 2022 \nTaught in 2022\nAE 265 - Structure and Properties of Materials Taught in 2020, 2021, 2022 \n Taught in 2020, 2021, 2022 \nTaught in 2020, 2021, 2022\nAE 325 - Project 1 Studio Taught in 2022 \n Taught in 2022 \nTaught in 2022\nCIVE 265 - Structure and Properties of Materials Taught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 \n Taught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 \nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022\nCIVE 512 - Rehabilitation of Structures Taught in 2020, 2021, 2023 \n Taught in 2020, 2021, 2023 \nTaught in 2020, 2021, 2023\nCIVE 701 - Topics in Mechanics Taught in 2022 \n Taught in 2022 \nTaught in 2022\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\nIn The News\n New civil and environmental engineering chair announced Engineering professor draws national prize \n New civil and environmental engineering chair announced Engineering professor draws national prize \nNew civil and environmental engineering chair announced\nNew civil and environmental engineering chair announced\nEngineering professor draws national prize\nEngineering professor draws national prize\nGraduate studies\n Currently considering applications from graduate students.

He has developed a formal theory for pipelined circuits that is based on the conventional ideas of structural hazards, control hazards, data hazards and datapath functionality. Professor Aagaard\u2019s current research activities use different formalization aspects of pipeline hazards to explore new design and verification techniques for varying classes of hazards. \n \nSome recent projects of Professor Aagaard\u2019s include verifying data-hazard accuracy, exploiting the power and usability of an off-the-shelf combinational equivalence checker, and developing a prototype design and verification tool that includes a cell library of control components for pipeline stages. Professor Aagaard also took part in creating the Microbox framework for microprocessor correctness statements, where over 30 published verification results were analyzed and proved correctness statement conditions.\nResearch interests\n Formal verification Design and verification of digital hardware system Computer architecture Computer & software engineering Connectivity and internet of things Wireless communications and networks Cybersecurity Application security Information security Infrastructure integrity Network Security Connectivity and Internet of Things IoT Devices Application domains Dependability and security \nFormal verification\nDesign and verification of digital hardware system\nComputer architecture\nComputer & software engineering\nConnectivity and internet of things\nWireless communications and networks\nCybersecurity\nApplication security\nInformation security\nInfrastructure integrity\nNetwork Security\nConnectivity and Internet of Things\nIoT\nDevices\nApplication domains\nDependability and security\nEducation\n 1994, Doctorate, Electrical Engineering, Cornell University 1991, Master of Science, Electrical Engineering, Cornell University 1988, Bachelor of Science (BS), Electrical Engineering, Harvey Mudd College \n 1994, Doctorate, Electrical Engineering, Cornell University \n 1991, Master of Science, Electrical Engineering, Cornell University \n 1988, Bachelor of Science (BS), Electrical Engineering, Harvey Mudd College \nCourses*\n ECE 108 - Discrete Mathematics and Logic 1Taught in 2024 ECE 327 - Digital Hardware SystemsTaught in 2019, 2020 ECE 627 - Register-transfer-level Digital SystemsTaught in 2020 \nECE 108 - Discrete Mathematics and Logic 1Taught in 2024\nTaught in 2024\nTaught in 2024\nECE 327 - Digital Hardware SystemsTaught in 2019, 2020\nTaught in 2019, 2020\nTaught in 2019, 2020\nECE 627 - Register-transfer-level Digital SystemsTaught in 2020\nTaught in 2020\nTaught in 2020\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\nSelected/recent publications\n Khalvati, Farzad and Aagaard, Mark D and Tizhoosh, Hamid R, Window memoization: toward high-performance image processing software, Journal of Real-Time Image Processing, 10(1), 2015, 5 - 25 Yang, Gangqiang and Aagaard, Mark D and Gong, Guang, Efficient Hardware Implementations of the Warbler Pseudorandom Number Generator, , 2015 O'Leary, John and Linderman, Mark and Leeser, Miriam and Aagaard, Mark, HML: A Hardware Description Language, Computer Hardware Description Languages and their Applications: Proceedings of the 11th IFIP WG10. 2 International Conference on Computer Hardware Description Languages and their Applications-CHDL'93 Sponsored by IFIP WG10. 2 and in cooperation with , 32, 2014 Aagaard, Mark and Leeser, Miriam, A methodology for reusable hardware proofs, Proceedings of the IFIP TC10/WG10, 2, 2014, 177 - 196 Mandal, Kalikinkar and Gong, Guang and Fan, Xinxin and Aagaard, Mark, Optimal parameters for the WG stream cipher family, Cryptography and Communications, 6(2), 2014, 117 - 135 \nKhalvati, Farzad and Aagaard, Mark D and Tizhoosh, Hamid R, Window memoization: toward high-performance image processing software, Journal of Real-Time Image Processing, 10(1), 2015, 5 - 25\n\nYang, Gangqiang and Aagaard, Mark D and Gong, Guang, Efficient Hardware Implementations of the Warbler Pseudorandom Number Generator, , 2015\n\nO'Leary, John and Linderman, Mark and Leeser, Miriam and Aagaard, Mark, HML: A Hardware Description Language, Computer Hardware Description Languages and their Applications: Proceedings of the 11th IFIP WG10. 2 International Conference on Computer Hardware Description Languages and their Applications-CHDL'93 Sponsored by IFIP WG10. 2 and in cooperation with , 32, 2014\n\nAagaard, Mark and Leeser, Miriam, A methodology for reusable hardware proofs, Proceedings of the IFIP TC10/WG10, 2, 2014, 177 - 196\n\nMandal, Kalikinkar and Gong, Guang and Fan, Xinxin and Aagaard, Mark, Optimal parameters for the WG stream cipher family, Cryptography and Communications, 6(2), 2014, 117 - 135\n\nGraduate studies\n Currently considering applications from graduate students.
