Professor Hansson is also a member of the Executive Committee of the Board of Governors of Acta Materialia and was appointed as Executive Secretary in 2014. \nHer research interests include durability of construction materials, corrosion and electrochemical techniques. Professor Hansson studies the corrosion of steel inside concrete, and techniques for measuring the amount of corrosion. These techniques include electrical metres that look for rust indirectly by measuring the current in the iron and acoustic monitors that listen for the ping of cables snapping within bridges. She is also studying rust-resistant reinforcing materials, such as stainless steel. This research is important to maintaining the integrity of structures.\nResearch interests\n Materials science and engineering Durability of materials Cement and concrete Reinforcing bar corrosion Electrochemical corrosion testing \nMaterials science and engineering\nDurability of materials\nCement and concrete\nReinforcing bar corrosion\nElectrochemical corrosion testing\nEducation\n 1966, Doctorate, Metallurgical Engineering, Imperial College, London University 1962, Bachelor's, Metallurgical Engineeering, Imperial College, London University \n 1966, Doctorate, Metallurgical Engineering, Imperial College, London University \n 1962, Bachelor's, Metallurgical Engineeering, Imperial College, London University \nCourses*\n BME 282 - Materials Science for Biomedical EngineersTaught in 2019 ME 731 - Corrosion and OxidationTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021 \nBME 282 - Materials Science for Biomedical EngineersTaught in 2019\nTaught in 2019\nTaught in 2019\nME 731 - Corrosion and OxidationTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021\nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021\nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\nSelected/recent publications\n Van Niejenhuis, CB and Bandura, TW and Hansson, CM, Evaluation of the proposed European test procedure for ranking stainless steel rebar, Corrosion, 72(6), 2016, 834 - 842 Hansson, CM, Corrosion of stainless steel in concrete, Corrosion of Steel in Concrete Structures, 2016 Hansson, CM, An introduction to corrosion of engineering materials, Corrosion of Steel in Concrete Structures, 2016 Van Niejenhuis, CB and Walbridge, S and Hansson, CM, The performance of austenitic and duplex stainless steels in cracked concrete exposed to concentrated chloride brine, Journal of Materials Science, 51(1), 2016, 362 - 374 Hunt, MJ and Hansson, CM, The Influence of the Cations in Anti-Icing Brines on the Corrosion of Reinforcing Steel in Synthetic Concrete Pore Solution, Corrosion, 71(6), 2015, 749 - 757 \nVan Niejenhuis, CB and Bandura, TW and Hansson, CM, Evaluation of the proposed European test procedure for ranking stainless steel rebar, Corrosion, 72(6), 2016, 834 - 842\n\nHansson, CM, Corrosion of stainless steel in concrete, Corrosion of Steel in Concrete Structures, 2016\n\nHansson, CM, An introduction to corrosion of engineering materials, Corrosion of Steel in Concrete Structures, 2016\n\nVan Niejenhuis, CB and Walbridge, S and Hansson, CM, The performance of austenitic and duplex stainless steels in cracked concrete exposed to concentrated chloride brine, Journal of Materials Science, 51(1), 2016, 362 - 374\n\nHunt, MJ and Hansson, CM, The Influence of the Cations in Anti-Icing Brines on the Corrosion of Reinforcing Steel in Synthetic Concrete Pore Solution, Corrosion, 71(6), 2015, 749 - 757\n\nGraduate studies\n Not currently accepting applications for graduate students \nNot currently accepting applications for graduate students"}, {"profile": "https://experts.uwaterloo.ca/bonwoo-koo", "name": "Bonwoo Koo", "position": "Associate Professor  Faculty of Engineering Department of Management Sciences ", "email": "bonkoo@uwaterloo.ca", "expertise": ["Economics of biotechnology", "Economics of intellectual property rights", "Green technology", "Innovation and entrepreneurship", "Intellectual propert", "Intellectual properties", "Licensing and contracts in technology", "Open source innovation", "Research and development and innovation incentive", "Technology management and innovation"], "bio": " Associate Professor Email: bonkoo@uwaterloo.ca Location: CPH 4327 Phone: 519-888-4567 x37843 Bonwoo Koo Biography Bon Koo is an Associate Professor in the Department of Management Sciences at the University of Waterloo.

He is interested in developing scalable methods for manufacturing nanomaterials, including spatial atomic layer deposition and pulsed laser approaches. \n \nDr. Musselman performed his doctoral studies in the Department of Materials Science & Metallurgy at the University of Cambridge with Prof. Judith Driscoll. Dr. Musselman developed new electrochemical methods for fabricating cuprous oxide (Cu2O) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanomaterials, as well as Cu2O-ZnO solar cells. In 2010 Dr. Musselman was appointed the Hertha Ayrton Junior Research Fellow in Science at Girton College, Cambridge University. He performed his research in the Department of Physics with Sir Richard Friend. Dr. Musselman helped pioneer the use of atmospheric pressure spatial atomic layer deposition (AP-SALD) thin films in optoelectronic devices. He produced thin films of metal oxide alloys with tunable optoelectronic properties with which he probed loss mechanisms in colloidal quantum dot solar cells, \u2018hybrid\u2019 polymer-oxide solar cells and light emitting diodes, and all-oxide solar cells. These metal oxide films were also used to produce new, colour-pure \u201chybrid\u201d organometal halide perovskite light-emitting diodes.\nResearch interests\n Nanomaterials Spatial atomic layer deposition Photovoltaic solar cells Nanoelectronics and sensors Electrochemistry Connectivity and Internet of Things Nanotechnology IoT Devices \nNanomaterials\nSpatial atomic layer deposition\nPhotovoltaic solar cells\nNanoelectronics and sensors\nElectrochemistry\nConnectivity and Internet of Things\nNanotechnology\nIoT\nDevices\nEducation\n 2010, Doctorate, Materials Science, University of Cambridge 2006, Master of Science, Physics, University of British Columbia 2004, Bachelor of Science (BSc), Engineering Physics, Queen's University \n 2010, Doctorate, Materials Science, University of Cambridge \n 2006, Master of Science, Physics, University of British Columbia \n 2004, Bachelor of Science (BSc), Engineering Physics, Queen's University \nCourses*\n ME 115 -

Lab-On-Chip (LOC) devices are micro scale laboratories on a microchip that can perform clinical diagnoses, scan DNA, run electrophoretic separations, act as micro reactors, detect cancer cells and identify bacteria and viruses. \nThe objective of Professor Li\u2019s current research program is to develop quantitative microfluidic technologies that enable the chip-scale design and operation control of pumping, metering, switching, sample injection/dispensing, mixing, reacting, and separating processes. His research includes developing Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) chips for detecting bacteria and viruses, DNA sensing chips, real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) chip systems, dielectrophoresis cell detection chip, and cellular lab on a chip. \nThe typical lab on a chip is a thin glass or plastic plate with a network of microchannels etched into its surface. These microchannels are about 10 microns deep, 50 microns wide, and several centimeters in length. \nA liquid sample (as little as 100 picoliters) is injected at one end of a microchannel. Electric fields propel the sample along the channels, past reservoir chambers that squirt measured amounts of reactants into the sample as it moves over detectors that scrutinize the progress of the reaction. On such a chip, hundreds of different reactions and analyses can be performed at the same time through hundreds of parallel microchannels. The advantage of labs on a chip are that they include a very small sample amount, very short reaction and analysis time and high throughput, and portability. These are the medical and technical drivers of next generation - handheld, portable, biodiagnotic devices.\nResearch interests\n Microfluidics and Nanofluidics Lab-on-a-Chip Interfacial Phenomena Biomechanics and Biotechnology Water Nanotechnology \nMicrofluidics and Nanofluidics\nLab-on-a-Chip\nInterfacial Phenomena\nBiomechanics and Biotechnology\nWater\nNanotechnology\nEducation\n 1991, Doctorate, PhD, University of Toronto 1984, Master's, MSc, Dalian Marine University 1982, Bachelor's, BASc, Zhejiang University \n 1991, Doctorate, PhD, University of Toronto \n 1984, Master's, MSc, Dalian Marine University \n 1982, Bachelor's, BASc, Zhejiang University \nCourses*\n ME 250 - Thermodynamics 1Taught in 2019, 2020, 2022 ME 750 - Advanced Engineering ThermodynamicsTaught in 2019, 2021, 2022 MTE 309 - Introduction to Thermodynamics and Heat TransferTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2023 \nME 250 - Thermodynamics 1Taught in 2019, 2020, 2022\nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2022\nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2022\nME 750 - Advanced Engineering ThermodynamicsTaught in 2019, 2021, 2022\nTaught in 2019, 2021, 2022\nTaught in 2019, 2021, 2022\nMTE 309 - Introduction to Thermodynamics and Heat TransferTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2023\nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2023\nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2023\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\nSelected/recent publications\n Peng, Ran and Li, Dongqing, Electroosmotic flow in single PDMS nanochannels, Nanoscale, 2016 Wang, Chengfa and Song, Yongxin and Pan, Xinxiang and Li, Dongqing, A novel microfluidic valve controlledby induced charge electro-osmotic flow, Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering, 26(7), 2016, 75002 - 75009 Li, Mengqi and Li, Dongqing, Vortices around Janus droplets under externally applied electrical field, Microfluidics and Nanofluidics, 20(5), 2016, 1 - 10 Zhang, Fang and Li, Dongqing, Separation of dielectric Janus particles based on polarizability-dependent induced-charge electroosmotic flow, Journal of colloid and interface science, 448, 2015, 297 - 305 Peng, Ran and Li, Dongqing, Fabrication of nanochannels on polystyrene surface, Biomicrofluidics, 9(2), 2015 \nPeng, Ran and Li, Dongqing, Electroosmotic flow in single PDMS nanochannels, Nanoscale, 2016\n\nWang, Chengfa and Song, Yongxin and Pan, Xinxiang and Li, Dongqing, A novel microfluidic valve controlledby induced charge electro-osmotic flow, Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering, 26(7), 2016, 75002 - 75009\n\nLi, Mengqi and Li, Dongqing, Vortices around Janus droplets under externally applied electrical field, Microfluidics and Nanofluidics, 20(5), 2016, 1 - 10\n\nZhang, Fang and Li, Dongqing, Separation of dielectric Janus particles based on polarizability-dependent induced-charge electroosmotic flow, Journal of colloid and interface science, 448, 2015, 297 - 305\n\nPeng, Ran and Li, Dongqing, Fabrication of nanochannels on polystyrene surface, Biomicrofluidics, 9(2), 2015\n\nGraduate studies\n Currently considering applications from graduate students.

From 2000 to 2004 he was a senior R&D engineer with a semiconductor equipment manufacturer, ESEC, in Switzerland. He received a diploma (masters) degree in Physics in 1994 and a PhD degree in Technical Sciences in 2000, both from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich. Michael has prior experience as a senior process engineer, project leader, and intellectual property responsible. Since joining the University of Waterloo, Michael has conducted projects with several companies including Microbonds Inc., MK Electron, Bosch, Oerlikon, Intel Corp., Kulicke and Soffa, Orthodyne Electronics, Futurewei, Microfab AG, Montfort Lasers, and others. Michael is serving on the executive committee of the IEEE Electronics Components and Technology Conference. Michael has co-authored many technical publications and patents. He has developed improved bonding methods and various microsensor tools for diagnostics of processes and reliability of microjoints and more recently has been working on direct bonding and laser joining of biological materials. Scholarly Research Miniaturized joining (microjoining) processes are essential to microelectronics and include microelectronic soldering and ultrasonic wire bonding. In our research, we contribute e.g. to the identification and description of processes and reliability, real-time monitoring of mechanisms during microjoining using e.g. custom developed ultrasonic sensors, and numerical modeling. Microjoining is also important for the automotive, medical devices, and aerospace industries. Welding biological materials with laser has promising applications in surgery. There is a need for practical solutions e.g. when sealing living skin of organs after surgery or e.g. for improved repair-processes for vessel ruptures. We are working towards studying how parameters such as laser energy, auxiliary process materials, and inventive mechanical setups can assist laser joining (laser welding) of biological materials. Direct Bonding is the joining of two components based on atomic bonding of its surface atoms. For direct bonding to be successful, the faying surfaces must be sufficiently smooth, flat, and clean. It can be extremely tricky to achieve these requirements. Nevertheless, direct bonding promises for improvements in the fields of photonics and 3D integrated circuits. We are working towards direct bonding processes for optical glasses for the subsequent production of more economical solid state lasers. Industrial Research Graduate researchers in Michael\u2019s group conduct experimental, analytical, and numerical investigations. They work with new materials, methods, and theories, and collaborate with other research groups on campus.

Professor Peterson also holds an affiliated faculty position in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University. \nThe UW Fluid Flow Physics group focuses on understanding fundamental and applied fluid mechanics problems using a blend of analytical modelling, numerical simulation, and experimental observation. Current research topics include understanding the influence of implanted stents on flow structures in curved arteries, robotic fish propulsion using novel smart materials, and energy harvesting from coherent fluid structures. \nOne of professor Peterson\u2019s research projects is Energy Harvesting from Small-Scale Fluid Structures, which addresses the challenge of extracting usable energy from small-scale aquatic environments. More specifically, this program seeks to exploit coherent fluid flow structures for energy harvesting. \nProfessor Peterson\u2019s group is also heavily involved in studying the Laminar Flow in a Curved Tube with an Implanted Stent Model. This research examines the role of stent struts, that is, implanted mechanical devices for reopening an occluded vessel, on the axial and secondary fluid flow development. This problem is tackled from an analytical perspective, modelling the stent as a small perturbation to a nominally circular cross-sectional geometry, as well as experimentally and numerically when the flow parameters and geometry are such that the analytical problem is intractable. This fundamental flow study has implications beyond the vasculature, such as heat transfer and mixing.\nResearch interests\n Fluid mechanics Biofluid mechanics Cardiovascular flows Energy harvesting Fluid-structure interaction Underwater propulsion Smart materials Vortex dynamics Optical diagnostic methods for fluid mechanics \nFluid mechanics\nBiofluid mechanics\nCardiovascular flows\nEnergy harvesting\nFluid-structure interaction\nUnderwater propulsion\nSmart materials\nVortex dynamics\nOptical diagnostic methods for fluid mechanics\nEducation\n 2006, Doctorate, Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University 2001, Master of Science, Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University 1998, Bachelor of Science (BSc), Mechanical Engineering, Arizona State University \n 2006, Doctorate, Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University \n 2001, Master of Science, Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University \n 1998, Bachelor of Science (BSc), Mechanical Engineering, Arizona State University \nCourses*\n ME 351 - Fluid Mechanics 1Taught in 2021, 2022 ME 362 - Fluid Mechanics 2Taught in 2019, 2021, 2023 ME 562 - Experimental Methods in FluidsTaught in 2023 ME 564 - AerodynamicsTaught in 2020, 2022 ME 765 - Special Topics in Fluid MechanicsTaught in 2019, 2023 \nME 351 - Fluid Mechanics 1Taught in 2021, 2022\nTaught in 2021, 2022\nTaught in 2021, 2022\nME 362 - Fluid Mechanics 2Taught in 2019, 2021, 2023\nTaught in 2019, 2021, 2023\nTaught in 2019, 2021, 2023\nME 562 - Experimental Methods in FluidsTaught in 2023\nTaught in 2023\nTaught in 2023\nME 564 - AerodynamicsTaught in 2020, 2022\nTaught in 2020, 2022\nTaught in 2020, 2022\nME 765 - Special Topics in Fluid MechanicsTaught in 2019, 2023\nTaught in 2019, 2023\nTaught in 2019, 2023\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\nSelected/recent publications\n Landry, Cederick, Peterson, Sean, and Arami, Arash, A fusion approach to improve accuracy and estimate uncertainty in cuffless blood pressure monitoring, Scientific Reports, 12(7948), 2022, 1 - 10Link Book, Jennifer and Prince, Chekema N and Villar, Rodrigo and Hughson, Richard L and Peterson, Sean D, Investigating the impact of passive external lower limb compression on central and peripheral hemodynamics during exercise, European journal of applied physiology, 116(4), 2016, 717 - 727 Cellini, Filippo and Block, Leanne and Li, Jie and Khapli, Sachin and Peterson, Sean D and Porfiri, Maurizio, Mechanochromic response of pyrene functionalized nanocomposite hydrogels, Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, 234, 2016, 510 - 520 Cha, Youngsu and Chae, Woojin and Kim, Hubert and Walcott, Horace and Peterson, Sean D and Porfiri, Maurizio, Energy harvesting from a piezoelectric biomimetic fish tail, Renewable Energy, 86, 2016, 449 - 458 Cellini, Filippo and Zhou, Liwei and Khapli, Sachin and Peterson, Sean D and Porfiri, Maurizio, Large deformations and fluorescence response of mechanochromic polyurethane sensors, Mechanics of Materials, 93, 2016, 145 - 162 Hadwin, Paul J and Galindo, Gabriel E and Daun, Kyle J and Za\u00f1artu, Mat\u00edas and Erath, Byron D and Cataldo, Edson and Peterson, Sean D, Non-stationary Bayesian estimation of parameters from a body cover model of the vocal folds, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 139(5), 2016, 2683 - 2696 \nLandry, Cederick, Peterson, Sean, and Arami, Arash, A fusion approach to improve accuracy and estimate uncertainty in cuffless blood pressure monitoring, Scientific Reports, 12(7948), 2022, 1 - 10Link\n\nLink\nBook, Jennifer and Prince, Chekema N and Villar, Rodrigo and Hughson, Richard L and Peterson, Sean D, Investigating the impact of passive external lower limb compression on central and peripheral hemodynamics during exercise, European journal of applied physiology, 116(4), 2016, 717 - 727\n\nCellini, Filippo and Block, Leanne and Li, Jie and Khapli, Sachin and Peterson, Sean D and Porfiri, Maurizio, Mechanochromic response of pyrene functionalized nanocomposite hydrogels, Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, 234, 2016, 510 - 520\n\nCha, Youngsu and Chae, Woojin and Kim, Hubert and Walcott, Horace and Peterson, Sean D and Porfiri, Maurizio, Energy harvesting from a piezoelectric biomimetic fish tail, Renewable Energy, 86, 2016, 449 - 458\n\nCellini, Filippo and Zhou, Liwei and Khapli, Sachin and Peterson, Sean D and Porfiri, Maurizio, Large deformations and fluorescence response of mechanochromic polyurethane sensors, Mechanics of Materials, 93, 2016, 145 - 162\n\nHadwin, Paul J and Galindo, Gabriel E and Daun, Kyle J and Za\u00f1artu, Mat\u00edas and Erath, Byron D and Cataldo, Edson and Peterson, Sean D, Non-stationary Bayesian estimation of parameters from a body cover model of the vocal folds, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 139(5), 2016, 2683 - 2696\n\nGraduate studies\n Currently considering applications from graduate students.

His research interests are in orthopaedic biomechanics, the design of biomedical devices, and tissue engineering. Professor Chandrashekar and his team are conducting innovative research on the anterior cruciate ligament, commonly known as the ACL. He has designed a simulator to enact the movements of a human knee to measure the damage inflicted on the ACL during athletic maneuvers. A sensor is attached to the mechanical ligament on the knee simulator, and readings from the sensor provide insight into how different motions and factors like movement from the hip influence the injury.

Dr. Cronin\u2019s expertise lies in the areas of impact mechanics, material characterization applied to trauma biomechanics, auto crash and occupant simulation, and multi-material lightweight vehicles. The development of advanced numerical models and interpretation of physical test data for impact events requires a fundamental understanding of high-deformation rate material properties, followed by implementation using appropriate constitutive equations in numerical codes. Test equipment supporting this research includes a suite of high deformation rate Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar apparatus; and intermediate, rate and standard hydraulic test frames to measure mechanical properties, complemented by high-speed imaging and digital image correlation. The field of Impact Biomechanics seeks to understand the response of the human body to high-rate loading, the potential for injury or trauma, and methods to mitigate injury. Research areas include characterization and constitutive modelling for biological tissues, finite element implementations, and human body modelling. Detailed human body models represent an evolution in assessing occupant safety in vehicle crash scenarios through Virtual Vehicle Evaluation, and also act as tools for the design of improved vehicle safety. These innovative human models are also used to improve blast protection for the head, thorax and lower extremity, and to develop enhanced ballistic protection to mitigate Behind Armour Blunt Trauma (BABT). Professor Cronin\u2019s research led him to serving on 2 NATO task groups and acting as a subject matter expert in the areas of blast and ballistic protection. He was a is a council member and board member on the International Research Council on Biomechanics of Injury (IRCOBI) for 10 years, and currently leads the Neck Model Centre of Expertise for the Global Human Body Models Consortium.

She is also a member of Waterloo Engineering\u2019s Fire Research Group and the Waterloo Institute for Sustainable Energy. Her research group focuses on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for turbulent reacting flows. They are interested in developing and implementing new mathematical models for problems related to turbulent mixing, flame stabilization and emissions. Applications are diverse; ranging from aero and automotive engines to fire scenario analysis. More recently, some research activities have been devoted to numerical simulations of two-phase flows and compartment fires related to the nuclear industry. Professor Devaud has special interest in using simulation to understand the relationship between turbulence and fire, specifically how turbulence can reduce or intensify fire, how fire can increase turbulence, and how these processes contribute to the growth or extinction of fires. She also studies the more subtle dangers of fire, such as toxic gases like carbon monoxide and particulates like soot. The implications of her research are practical and result in greater safety for firefighters and those they rescue. Professor Devaud holds a US patent along with Waterloo professors \u2013 Amir Khajepour, A. Fazeli and A. Nasser for \u201cAir hybrid engine with a plurality of air tanks\".
