The curriculum includes a virtual reality experience centered on the oral histories of former residents of the Home. The project takes a restorative approach to the redress of historical harms in education. The curriculum was featured on CBC\u2019s The National. Currently, the research team is working with the Nova Scotia Black Cultural Centre to create an exhibit around DOHR, including a school resource kit. The team has also expanded, supported by a New Frontiers grant, to explore the use of haptics for storytelling in the museum exhibit. Thinking Historically for Canada\u2019s Future This national project, supported by a SSHRC partnership grant, is studying the state of history education in Canada. The team is identifying and developing evidenced-based practices for engaged history teaching and learning. The project will provide recommendations for reforms and innovations in history education.

The curriculum includes a virtual reality experience centered on the oral histories of former residents of the Home. The project takes a restorative approach to the redress of historical harms in education. The curriculum was featured on CBC\u2019s The National. Currently, the research team is working with the Nova Scotia Black Cultural Centre to create an exhibit around DOHR, including a school resource kit. The team has also expanded, supported by a New Frontiers grant, to explore the use of haptics for storytelling in the museum exhibit. Thinking Historically for Canada\u2019s Future This national project, supported by a SSHRC partnership grant, is studying the state of history education in Canada. The team is identifying and developing evidenced-based practices for engaged history teaching and learning. The project will provide recommendations for reforms and innovations in history education. Currently, the research team is engaged in a comprehensive analysis of history curricula and textbooks/resources across Canada.

Recent challenges on the use of School Resource Officers (SRO) brought to the forefront the absence of evidence on the effectiveness of police officers in schools and the negative impact on youth, especially for Black, Indigenous, racialized, and vulnerable youth. Our understanding is limited as prior research is largely culture and race absent. Police work is experienced differently by people and this crucial context includes community concerns, lived experiences, perceptions of effectiveness by all stakeholders, key performance indicators to measure program success, and the variability of youth community mobilization strategies. This SSHRC-funded participatory-action research responds to the demand for police reform and removal of police officers in schools by evaluating the OPP School Resource Officer Program and how police interact with youth, and doing so through an equity, anti-oppression, and anti-racism lens. OPP officers and the public can share their opinions and experiences through surveys, Town Hall meetings, interviews, and online feedback. This is supplemented with data from patrol ride alongs and a statistical analysis of calls for service. The results will provide recommendations on: (1) whether the OPP SRO Program should continue, change, or be eliminated; (2) identify potential alternative strategies for police interactions with youth; and (3) actionable steps to address inequities, systemic, and institutional racism and discrimination experienced by youth when interacting with the police.

Recent challenges on the use of School Resource Officers (SRO) brought to the forefront the absence of evidence on the effectiveness of police officers in schools and the negative impact on youth, especially for Black, Indigenous, racialized, and vulnerable youth. Our understanding is limited as prior research is largely culture and race absent. Police work is experienced differently by people and this crucial context includes community concerns, lived experiences, perceptions of effectiveness by all stakeholders, key performance indicators to measure program success, and the variability of youth community mobilization strategies. This SSHRC-funded participatory-action research responds to the demand for police reform and removal of police officers in schools by evaluating the OPP School Resource Officer Program and how police interact with youth, and doing so through an equity, anti-oppression, and anti-racism lens. OPP officers and the public can share their opinions and experiences through surveys, Town Hall meetings, interviews, and online feedback. This is supplemented with data from patrol ride alongs and a statistical analysis of calls for service. The results will provide recommendations on: (1) whether the OPP SRO Program should continue, change, or be eliminated; (2) identify potential alternative strategies for police interactions with youth; and (3) actionable steps to address inequities, systemic, and institutional racism and discrimination experienced by youth when interacting with the police.

Recent challenges on the use of School Resource Officers (SRO) brought to the forefront the absence of evidence on the effectiveness of police officers in schools and the negative impact on youth, especially for Black, Indigenous, racialized, and vulnerable youth. Our understanding is limited as prior research is largely culture and race absent. Police work is experienced differently by people and this crucial context includes community concerns, lived experiences, perceptions of effectiveness by all stakeholders, key performance indicators to measure program success, and the variability of youth community mobilization strategies. This SSHRC-funded participatory-action research responds to the demand for police reform and removal of police officers in schools by evaluating the OPP School Resource Officer Program and how police interact with youth, and doing so through an equity, anti-oppression, and anti-racism lens. OPP officers and the public can share their opinions and experiences through surveys, Town Hall meetings, interviews, and online feedback. This is supplemented with data from patrol ride alongs and a statistical analysis of calls for service. The results will provide recommendations on: (1) whether the OPP SRO Program should continue, change, or be eliminated; (2) identify potential alternative strategies for police interactions with youth; and (3) actionable steps to address inequities, systemic, and institutional racism and discrimination experienced by youth when interacting with the police.

Our understanding is limited as prior research is largely culture and race absent. Police work is experienced differently by people and this crucial context includes community concerns, lived experiences, perceptions of effectiveness by all stakeholders, key performance indicators to measure program success, and the variability of youth community mobilization strategies. \n This SSHRC-funded participatory-action research responds to the demand for police reform and removal of police officers in schools by evaluating the OPP School Resource Officer Program and how police interact with youth, and doing so through an equity, anti-oppression, and anti-racism lens. OPP officers and the public can share their opinions and experiences through surveys, Town Hall meetings, interviews, and online feedback. This is supplemented with data from patrol ride alongs and a statistical analysis of calls for service. \n The results will provide recommendations on: (1) whether the OPP SRO Program should continue, change, or be eliminated; (2) identify potential alternative strategies for police interactions with youth; and (3) actionable steps to address inequities, systemic, and institutional racism and discrimination experienced by youth when interacting with the police. \n Research grants\n Research grants\n Principal Investigator, \u201cPolicing innovation: An investigation of targeted interventions and responses to youth crime\u201d.

Most of the time I study games and play. I'm particularly interested in the shifting production models of the global game industry, and tracing how risk management practices, datamining, and digital distribution shape developers' creative work and the larger cultural role of games. Predominantly, I carry out ethnographic work inside game studios. I use the example of the game industry to show how the design, deployment, and use of communication software is shaped by economic, social, technological and political concerns, which then create certain constraints and affordances in how people can use these technologies. For example, some of my work on gamification traces how governance and control are designed into games, smartphones, and websites, and how playful rationalities are used to shape use behaviour and thus govern through freedom rather than fear and risk.

Most of the time I study games and play. I'm particularly interested in the shifting production models of the global game industry, and tracing how risk management practices, datamining, and digital distribution shape developers' creative work and the larger cultural role of games. Predominantly, I carry out ethnographic work inside game studios. I use the example of the game industry to show how the design, deployment, and use of communication software is shaped by economic, social, technological and political concerns, which then create certain constraints and affordances in how people can use these technologies. For example, some of my work on gamification traces how governance and control are designed into games, smartphones, and websites, and how playful rationalities are used to shape use behaviour and thus govern through freedom rather than fear and risk.

The book is a study of contemporary Latin American cultural production that reframes the analysis of the word/image relationship in terms of the philosophical critique of representation to recognize that words and images deploy epistemological fields that are irreducible to one another. The tension resulting from these two epistemologies coming into contact as word/image \u2013where they are made to account for what always remains just beyond their means\u2013 is understood then as the force that has, for centuries, made the intersection of the visual and the verbal such a fertile ground for the cultivation of human imagination. Through the work of Argentina avant-garde artist Xul Solar (1887-1963), I analyze a hybrid form of the relationship that combines words and images in the space of representation. The images of don Quixote created by Mexican artists Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada (1852-1913) and Alfredo Zalce (1908-2003) represent a purely visual form of word/image as they transpose Cervantes\u2019 character across time and space, from literature into the visual arts. In the narrative of Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa I examine a verbal form of the relationship, and finally, an analysis of Jorge Luis Borges\u2019 and Maurits Cornelis Escher\u2019s works provides an ontology of word/image by focusing critical attention on its constitutive elements: the very limits of visual and verbal representation.

Through the work of Argentina avant-garde artist Xul Solar (1887-1963), I analyze a hybrid form of the relationship that combines words and images in the space of representation. The images of don Quixote created by Mexican artists Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada (1852-1913) and Alfredo Zalce (1908-2003) represent a purely visual form of word/image as they transpose Cervantes\u2019 character across time and space, from literature into the visual arts. In the narrative of Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa I examine a verbal form of the relationship, and finally, an analysis of Jorge Luis Borges\u2019 and Maurits Cornelis Escher\u2019s works provides an ontology of word/image by focusing critical attention on its constitutive elements: the very limits of visual and verbal representation.

Anderson is a Professor in the Chemical Engineering Department and the former Director of Admissions for the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Waterloo. With his expertise in photochemical (UV) and biological air and water pollution control and biochemical engineering of fermentation and pharmaceutical processes, Professor Anderson maintains industry research collaborations in the areas of hospital air emissions control, clinical water testing, residential air UV disinfection and agricultural resource recovery. His recent projects include automated UV disinfection in hospitals, rapid detection of microbial contamination of water, removal of ammonia from water, and antimicrobial materials for use in engineered infection control. A major emphasis of Professor Anderson\u2019s work in pollution control technology for air treatment is reactor engineering for photocatalysis and photolysis, using an ultraviolet light irradiated catalyst to degrade organic contaminants at ambient temperatures. He is frequently consulted by industry and others on the use of UV germicidal devices for disinfection of air, surfaces, and water. In addition to his research work, Professor Anderson has written over 105 journal articles, in addition to conference proceedings and technical reports. During his time as Director of Admissions, Professor Anderson started a blog about engineering undergraduate admissions which has been widely read by current and prospective Waterloo Engineering undergraduate students.

These projects intersect with research and theories of organizations, family, inequality, and technology. As a qualitative researcher, I use a variety of techniques to answer my research questions including interviews, field research, video-recorded observations, and photo-interviewing. I have also worked on several mixed method projects. My graduate students are intimately involved in these projects, collecting data through RAs and publishing articles and chapters with me. Several of my students are using these data for their theses. I am working on several projects and am currently accepting M.A. and Ph.D. I have funding opportunities for students working on these projects (however I am open to other topics/projects). To view current opportunities, see: My latest project was recently awarded a SSHRC Insight grant. Drawing on an ecological perspective and theories of social stratification and parenting, this project expands the scope of contemporary parenting research by clarifying the relationship between national stratification systems, parenting logics, and social reproduction. The research team will conduct interviews, demographic surveys, and time diaries with high-SES parents and a sub-sample of low-SES parents in three strategic research sites sporting drastically different higher education systems (HE): Boston, United States (highly stratified), Toronto, Canada (moderately stratified) and Berlin, Germany (xxx). My research will map the production of inequality across nations, using an ambitious comparative design to isolate how macro-level structures and parenting interact to form variable patterns of social stratification. This research will be relevant to ongoing policy efforts to promote more inclusive and equitable growth within Canada's HE system and labour market. I recently completed a multi-method project on robotics and 21st century competencies. We conducted focus groups, interviews, video-recorded observations and surveyed educators in nine Ontario school boards (with Drs. John McLevey, Robert Gorbet and Allyson Stokes). I was recently awarded a Connection Grant. The team hosted a two-day workshop, bringing together academics, industry stakeholders, and policy-makers to discuss changing education and labour market demands. We also wrote a white paper and are working on peer reviewed publications: Aurini, J., J. McLevey, A. Stokes, R. Gorbet and J.

Less advantaged children tend to lose literacy and numeracy skills over the summer months. This project examines the sources of these disparities and whether summer program interventions mitigate their impact. The project includes gathering quantitative and qualitative data on the effects of summer programs (with Scott Davies, Emily Milne and Cathlene Hillier). We have conducted over 200 interviews with teachers, parents and students and have spent many hours in the field examining the relationship between families and schools. We also conducted 35 interviews with students using a photo-interviewing technique. This research has generated a lot of media attention. Recently, I was on The Agenda and conducted over 30 radio interviews.

Projects on this topic include examining the rise of various forms of private education, determinants of school choice, and private education entrepreneurs. This research agenda broadly examines the growth and legitimacy of private education, and the relative impact of markets on decision-making. Most recently I co-edited a book on the global spread of supplementary education. Finally, I am working on the second edition of an advanced qualitative methods textbook with Dr. Melanie Heath (McMaster University) and Dr. Steph Howells (University of Guelph). Finally, I am working on a few Covid-19 and schooling projects and papers with researchers at the University of Waterloo, Memorial University, and the University of Toronto. http://www.fairchancelearning.com/education-onward https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/uwaterloo-pandemic-impacts-children-1.5695283 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBJT1W98tfM Selected publications Aurini, J. and S.

These projects intersect with research and theories of organizations, family, inequality, and technology. As a qualitative researcher, I use a variety of techniques to answer my research questions including interviews, field research, video-recorded observations, and photo-interviewing. I have also worked on several mixed method projects. My graduate students are intimately involved in these projects, collecting data through RAs and publishing articles and chapters with me. Several of my students are using these data for their theses. I am working on several projects and am currently accepting M.A. and Ph.D. I have funding opportunities for students working on these projects (however I am open to other topics/projects). To view current opportunities, see: My latest project was recently awarded a SSHRC Insight grant. Drawing on an ecological perspective and theories of social stratification and parenting, this project expands the scope of contemporary parenting research by clarifying the relationship between national stratification systems, parenting logics, and social reproduction. The research team will conduct interviews, demographic surveys, and time diaries with high-SES parents and a sub-sample of low-SES parents in three strategic research sites sporting drastically different higher education systems (HE): Boston, United States (highly stratified), Toronto, Canada (moderately stratified) and Berlin, Germany (xxx). My research will map the production of inequality across nations, using an ambitious comparative design to isolate how macro-level structures and parenting interact to form variable patterns of social stratification. This research will be relevant to ongoing policy efforts to promote more inclusive and equitable growth within Canada's HE system and labour market. I recently completed a multi-method project on robotics and 21st century competencies. We conducted focus groups, interviews, video-recorded observations and surveyed educators in nine Ontario school boards (with Drs. John McLevey, Robert Gorbet and Allyson Stokes). I was recently awarded a Connection Grant. The team hosted a two-day workshop, bringing together academics, industry stakeholders, and policy-makers to discuss changing education and labour market demands. We also wrote a white paper and are working on peer reviewed publications: Aurini, J., J. McLevey, A. Stokes, R. Gorbet and J.

Less advantaged children tend to lose literacy and numeracy skills over the summer months. This project examines the sources of these disparities and whether summer program interventions mitigate their impact. The project includes gathering quantitative and qualitative data on the effects of summer programs (with Scott Davies, Emily Milne and Cathlene Hillier). We have conducted over 200 interviews with teachers, parents and students and have spent many hours in the field examining the relationship between families and schools. We also conducted 35 interviews with students using a photo-interviewing technique. This research has generated a lot of media attention. Recently, I was on The Agenda and conducted over 30 radio interviews. For example: http://tvo.org/video/programs/the-agenda-with-steve-paikin/summer-learning-losses http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/janice-aurini-waterloo-first-summer-setback-study-in-canada-1.3721924 A sample policy report Building Confidence Making Connections: Continuing the Summer Literacy Learning Project in Ontario Schools can be found at: http://www.ontariodirectors.ca/summer_literacy.html I am also interested in the growth and change of the private education sector in Canada. Projects on this topic include examining the rise of various forms of private education, determinants of school choice, and private education entrepreneurs. This research agenda broadly examines the growth and legitimacy of private education, and the relative impact of markets on decision-making. Most recently I co-edited a book on the global spread of supplementary education. Finally, I am working on the second edition of an advanced qualitative methods textbook with Dr. Melanie Heath (McMaster University) and Dr. Steph Howells (University of Guelph). Finally, I am working on a few Covid-19 and schooling projects and papers with researchers at the University of Waterloo, Memorial University, and the University of Toronto. http://www.fairchancelearning.com/education-onward https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/uwaterloo-pandemic-impacts-children-1.5695283 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBJT1W98tfM Selected publications Aurini, J. and S.

Drawing on an ecological perspective and theories of social stratification and parenting, this project expands the scope of contemporary parenting research by clarifying the relationship between national stratification systems, parenting logics, and social reproduction. The research team will conduct interviews, demographic surveys, and time diaries with high-SES parents and a sub-sample of low-SES parents in three strategic research sites sporting drastically different higher education systems (HE): Boston, United States (highly stratified), Toronto, Canada (moderately stratified) and Berlin, Germany (xxx). My research will map the production of inequality across nations, using an ambitious comparative design to isolate how macro-level structures and parenting interact to form variable patterns of social stratification. This research will be relevant to ongoing policy efforts to promote more inclusive and equitable growth within Canada's HE system and labour market. I recently completed a multi-method project on robotics and 21st century competencies. We conducted focus groups, interviews, video-recorded observations and surveyed educators in nine Ontario school boards (with Drs. John McLevey, Robert Gorbet and Allyson Stokes). I was recently awarded a Connection Grant. The team hosted a two-day workshop, bringing together academics, industry stakeholders, and policy-makers to discuss changing education and labour market demands. We also wrote a white paper and are working on peer reviewed publications: Aurini, J., J. McLevey, A. Stokes, R. Gorbet and J. Rizk. 2019. \u201cEd-Tech Connect 2019: An Intersectoral Workshop on Education, Technology, and 21st Century Labour.\u201d https://cognit.ca/fr/research/project/184195 The third project examines a key source of educational disadvantage \u2013 summer setback. Less advantaged children tend to lose literacy and numeracy skills over the summer months. This project examines the sources of these disparities and whether summer program interventions mitigate their impact. The project includes gathering quantitative and qualitative data on the effects of summer programs (with Scott Davies, Emily Milne and Cathlene Hillier). We have conducted over 200 interviews with teachers, parents and students and have spent many hours in the field examining the relationship between families and schools. We also conducted 35 interviews with students using a photo-interviewing technique. This research has generated a lot of media attention. Recently, I was on The Agenda and conducted over 30 radio interviews.

Projects on this topic include examining the rise of various forms of private education, determinants of school choice, and private education entrepreneurs. This research agenda broadly examines the growth and legitimacy of private education, and the relative impact of markets on decision-making. Most recently I co-edited a book on the global spread of supplementary education. Finally, I am working on the second edition of an advanced qualitative methods textbook with Dr. Melanie Heath (McMaster University) and Dr. Steph Howells (University of Guelph).

I am particularly interested in these themes in relation to cities and urban governance. My previous research examined the securitization of the Olympic Games in the post-9/11 period. This research has been published in Security Dialogue, International Political Sociology, the British Journal of Sociology, the Canadian Journal of Sociology, and Urban Studies. I am currently working on a two-year project funded by a SSHRC Insight Development Grant (2014-2016) in which I am investigating the embrace of resilience in critical infrastructure security policy in Canada. This project is animated by my interests in the \u2018politics of catastrophe\u2019 and the question of how we plan for unknown and unknowable risks. \n Security Dialogue\n International Political Sociology\n British Journal of Sociology\n Canadian Journal of Sociology\n Urban Studies\n Selected publications\n Selected publications\n Boyle, P. \u2018Building a Safe & Resilience Canada: Resilience & the Mechanopolitics of Infrastructure.

While child welfare will always need formal services and foster placements to keep children safe, the overall goal of this project is to create safety and promote the wellbeing of vulnerable children where they live, and reduce reliance on intrusive measures and formal services, by building community around them and their families. If successful, this pilot project could revolutionize child welfare in Ontario. Objectives: This project involves tracking and critically assessing the processes and impacts of implementing a new pilot initiative in child welfare, and connecting it to community development theory. Community organization: Comparative case studies of community-based water activism Mixed methods case studies of opposition to Nestl\u00e9 Waters groundwater taking for bottling in various communities in Canada and US.

Funder: SSHRC Insight Development Grant Timeline: June 2021-May 2023 Environmental history: Oral history of the Water Watchers The Water Watchers (formerly \"Wellington Water Watchers\") is a volunteer-led community group that formed in 2006 in response to risks to local drinking water presented by quarrying and water bottling in the area. From its inception as a small group of friends sharing concerns, the Water Watchers has become a leading voice on groundwater issues in Ontario, attracting international attention and stimulating regulatory change at the provincial level. Objectives: Using media and archival review, participant observation, and life-history interviews, this project aims to document and analyze the history and evolution of the Water Watchers, and to draw lessons from this case study for scholarship and practice in community organization and social change.

While child welfare will always need formal services and foster placements to keep children safe, the overall goal of this project is to create safety and promote the wellbeing of vulnerable children where they live, and reduce reliance on intrusive measures and formal services, by building community around them and their families. If successful, this pilot project could revolutionize child welfare in Ontario. Objectives: This project involves tracking and critically assessing the processes and impacts of implementing a new pilot initiative in child welfare, and connecting it to community development theory. Community organization: Comparative case studies of community-based water activism Mixed methods case studies of opposition to Nestl\u00e9 Waters groundwater taking for bottling in various communities in Canada and US.

The curriculum includes a virtual reality experience centered on the oral histories of former residents of the Home. The project takes a restorative approach to the redress of historical harms in education. The curriculum was featured on CBC\u2019s The National. Currently, the research team is working with the Nova Scotia Black Cultural Centre to create an exhibit around DOHR, including a school resource kit. The team has also expanded, supported by a New Frontiers grant, to explore the use of haptics for storytelling in the museum exhibit. Thinking Historically for Canada\u2019s Future This national project, supported by a SSHRC partnership grant, is studying the state of history education in Canada. The team is identifying and developing evidenced-based practices for engaged history teaching and learning. The project will provide recommendations for reforms and innovations in history education. Currently, the research team is engaged in a comprehensive analysis of history curricula and textbooks/resources across Canada. In addition, I am co-editing with colleagues a collection on Women, Gender, and History Education in Canada.

(218 pages) Current research projects Digital Oral History for Reconciliation: The Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children History Education Initiative (DOHR) DOHR is a community-driven project, supported by SSHRC, that has created a history curriculum unit about the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children. The curriculum includes a virtual reality experience centered on the oral histories of former residents of the Home. The project takes a restorative approach to the redress of historical harms in education. The curriculum was featured on CBC\u2019s The National. Currently, the research team is working with the Nova Scotia Black Cultural Centre to create an exhibit around DOHR, including a school resource kit. The team has also expanded, supported by a New Frontiers grant, to explore the use of haptics for storytelling in the museum exhibit. Thinking Historically for Canada\u2019s Future This national project, supported by a SSHRC partnership grant, is studying the state of history education in Canada. The team is identifying and developing evidenced-based practices for engaged history teaching and learning. The project will provide recommendations for reforms and innovations in history education. Currently, the research team is engaged in a comprehensive analysis of history curricula and textbooks/resources across Canada. In addition, I am co-editing with colleagues a collection on Women, Gender, and History Education in Canada.

Her team studies the kinetics and mechanism of local hydrogen generation from heavy oil emulsion. Research for water as a medium for hydrocarbon processing is also underway. \n \nProfessor Ng\u2019s team has developed a process for the aldol condensation of acetone to diacetone alcohol using catalytic distillation. Catalytic distillation is a novel technology where reaction and separation occur in the same reactor. The group has developed mathematical models that could predict product yield and selectivity. \n \nReactive distillation (RD) processes are advantageous due to reduced capital costs and energy consumption, and higher reaction rates and selectivity. In conjunction with Dr. Rempel, Dr. Nkosi and her research team, Professor Ng developed a reactive distillation process to convert alkenes from low to high value, which is important for motor fuel and pharmaceutical production. This efficient invention involves depositing the catalyst on the inorganic oxide support structures, which prevents the need for secondary support structures typically associated with RD processes. \n \nProfessor Ng is also interested in the recycling of polymeric waste and has demonstrated that polyethylene pyrolysis could produce a premium cetane additive. Her team developed a novel approach to produce a premium diesel fuel (high cetane index and without sulfur) from polyethylene. \n \nSulfur content in gasoline and environmental concerns have inspired Professor Ng to make gasoline and diesel fuel sulfur-free. Her team pioneered the flow micro-calorimetric technique for determining the apparent heat of adsorption, sorbent capacity and the rate of adsorption. \n \nAs a result of her research work, Professor Ng, a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, received the 2013 Canadian Green Chemistry and Engineering Award, as well as the 2008 CIC Catalysis Award.\nRoyal Society of Canada\nResearch interests\n Catalytic distillation Solid acid catalysis Biodiesel Clean fuel Chemicals Green chemistry and engineering Biochemical & Biomedical Green Reaction Engineering Separation Processes Catalyst Development for Hydrocarbon Processing Heavy Oil and Emulsion Upgrading Production of Ultra Low S Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Recycling of Plastics Nanotechnology \nCatalytic distillation\nSolid acid catalysis\nBiodiesel\nClean fuel\nChemicals\nGreen chemistry and engineering\nBiochemical & Biomedical\nGreen Reaction Engineering\nSeparation Processes\nCatalyst Development for Hydrocarbon Processing\nHeavy Oil and Emulsion Upgrading\nProduction of Ultra Low S Gasoline and Diesel Fuel\nRecycling of Plastics\nNanotechnology\nEducation\n 1970, Doctorate, Thesis - Activation of Hydrogen, Olefins, Oxygen and Carbon Mononxide by Rhodium Complexes in Non Aqueous Solvents, University of British Columbia 1968, Master's, MSc, University of British Columbia 1968, Bachelor's, Thesis - Activation of Hydrogen by Rhodium and Iridium Chloro Complexes Containing Sulphide or Arsine Type Ligands, University of British Columbia 1966, Bachelor's, Chemistry, Physics, University of Hong Kong \n 1970, Doctorate, Thesis - Activation of Hydrogen, Olefins, Oxygen and Carbon Mononxide by Rhodium Complexes in Non Aqueous Solvents, University of British Columbia \n 1968, Master's, MSc, University of British Columbia \n 1968, Bachelor's, Thesis - Activation of Hydrogen by Rhodium and Iridium Chloro Complexes Containing Sulphide or Arsine Type Ligands, University of British Columbia \n 1966, Bachelor's, Chemistry, Physics, University of Hong Kong \nSelected/recent publications\n Hua, Yuxi and Guo, Xiaoming and Mao, Dongsen and Lu, Guanzhong and Rempel, Garry L and Ng, Flora TT, Single-step synthesis of dimethyl ether from biomass-derived syngas over CuO-ZnO-MOx (M= Zr, Al, Cr, Ti)/HZSM-5 hybrid catalyst: Effects of MOx, Applied Catalysis A: General, 540, 2017, 68 - 74 Iravani, Amir A and Gunda, Kamalakar and Ng, Flora TT, Adsorptive Removal of Refractory Sulphur Compounds by Tantalum Oxide Modified Activated Carbons, AIChE Journal, 2017 Mai, Chau TQ and Ng, Flora TT, Effect of Cs+ on the hydrogenolysis of glycerol to higher value sustainable and green chemicals using a supported Ni-HSiW catalyst, Catalysis Today, 291, 2017, 195 - 203 Mai, Chau TQ and Ng, Flora TT, Effect of metals on the hydrogenolysis of glycerol to higher value sustainable and green chemicals using a supported HSiW catalyst, Organic Process Research & Development, 20(10), 2016, 1774 - 1780 Gaurav, Aashish and Ng, Flora TT and Rempel, Garry L, A new green process for biodiesel production from waste oils via catalytic distillation using a solid acid catalyst--Modeling, economic and environmental analysis, Green Energy & Environment, 1(1), 2016, 62 - 74 \nHua, Yuxi and Guo, Xiaoming and Mao, Dongsen and Lu, Guanzhong and Rempel, Garry L and Ng, Flora TT, Single-step synthesis of dimethyl ether from biomass-derived syngas over CuO-ZnO-MOx (M= Zr, Al, Cr, Ti)/HZSM-5 hybrid catalyst: Effects of MOx, Applied Catalysis A: General, 540, 2017, 68 - 74\n\nIravani, Amir A and Gunda, Kamalakar and Ng, Flora TT, Adsorptive Removal of Refractory Sulphur Compounds by Tantalum Oxide Modified Activated Carbons, AIChE Journal, 2017\n\nMai, Chau TQ and Ng, Flora TT, Effect of Cs+ on the hydrogenolysis of glycerol to higher value sustainable and green chemicals using a supported Ni-HSiW catalyst, Catalysis Today, 291, 2017, 195 - 203\n\nMai, Chau TQ and Ng, Flora TT, Effect of metals on the hydrogenolysis of glycerol to higher value sustainable and green chemicals using a supported HSiW catalyst, Organic Process Research & Development, 20(10), 2016, 1774 - 1780\n\nGaurav, Aashish and Ng, Flora TT and Rempel, Garry L, A new green process for biodiesel production from waste oils via catalytic distillation using a solid acid catalyst--Modeling, economic and environmental analysis, Green Energy & Environment, 1(1), 2016, 62 - 74\n\nGraduate studies\n Currently considering applications from graduate students.

Their computerized tools, which utilize advanced mathematics, machine learning algorithms and uncertainty analyses, can simulate how chemical systems are likely to behave in real life. These simulations can be analyzed and used to maximize economic investment and process efficiency, often before any resources are used. They provide a fast, efficient and safe way to, for example, effectively and efficiently design new chemical materials and improve chemical process operations.

of Waterloo. Professor Fowler\u2019s research focuses on electrochemical power sources in vehicles, specifically degradation analysis and control of batteries in hybrid and plug-in hybrid power trains. His interest takes him into the modelling of fuel cells and requires simulating the performance and reliability of fuel cells and batteries. Professor Fowler\u2019s research group is interested in performance evaluation, diagnostics, and forensics associated with fuel cell stacks, single cells and batteries. His study of fuel cell failure mode and reliability also encompasses the extensive development of polymers due to their function as the fuel cells\u2019 electrolyte, gas diffusion layer and blending of polymers for conductive bipolar plates. One of the key questions to be addressed in the 'hydrogen economy' is the clean production and distribution of hydrogen. Through a series of publications and presentations, his work has furthered the concept of 'clean energy hubs' as distributed energy generation systems including wind and solar, and large scale systems with CO2 free nuclear energy as a key components of the hubs. Unique to this work is the consideration the integration of natural gas and electrical distribution systems through the \u2018Power to Gas\u2019 concept of energy storage and distribution. This work has principally included hydrogen as an energy vector, but also considered the impact of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles within such clean energy hubs. His expertise in fuel cell technology has landed him the position of co-faculty supervisor of competitive vehicle team design projects; ChallengeX and EcoCar where he has supervised the development of two fuel cell vehicles, and two plug-in hybrid vehicle. Professor Fowler assists these teams with their design, construction, implementation and testing of hybrid vehicles. He also supervises other award winning student teams in the design of Green Energy Systems.

Her goal is to characterize key enzyme kinetics by understanding the enzymes involved in these complex multiphase processes. \nMembrane filtration is limited by fouling of the membrane. Professor Moresoli is investigating the causes of fouling through experimentation, along with a systematic mathematical analysis of the transport phenomena and their relationship with the physical characteristics of the feed and target product. In 2010 and 2011, MITACS granted Professor Moresoli $70,000 for her research in membrane fouling and filtration. She then formed a partnership with GE Water and Process Technologies, aiming to develop fluorescence based monitoring strategies to identify and reduce membrane foulants in drinking water treatment applications. \nAn additional project that Professor Moresoli has undertaken is evaluating the suitability of soybean proteins that satisfy the structural and functional criteria for producing industrial films. The biomedical industry is poised to benefit from such a project as protein films can be used to produce wound closures. They can also be used to strengthen plastic materials in the manufacturing of high performance textiles and in biodegradable food packaging applications. \nIn addition to her impressive research contributions, Professor Moresoli also received the Faculty of Engineering\u2019s Teaching Excellence Award in 2011. \nChristine Moresoli is a member of the Waterloo Centre for Microbial Research.\nWaterloo Centre for Microbial Research\nResearch interests\n Membrane filtration Protein recovery and purification Diffusion Enzyme reaction engineering Food and environmental engineering Biochemical & Biomedical Separation Processes Water \nMembrane filtration\nProtein recovery and purification\nDiffusion\nEnzyme reaction engineering\nFood and environmental engineering\nBiochemical & Biomedical\nSeparation Processes\nWater\nEducation\n 1990, Doctorate, Es Sc.

Engineering at the University of Waterloo. \nDepartment of Chemical Engineering\nProfessor Budman\u2019s research is multi-disciplinary, leading him to undertake collaborative work in pharmaceuticals, water treatment, minerals processing, and pulp and paper industries. \nTypically when a system is modeled, there is some difference between the actual process and the model. As a result, control systems based on process models have to be designed to compensate for the difference. Professor Budman\u2019s research investigates the application of robust control theory to advance control techniques such as Model Predictive Control, Inferential Control and Non-Linear Control. In order to deal with the model inaccuracy, Professor Budman studies methods for quantifying the model uncertainty from experimental data. He also designs steady state estimators so that controlled variables can be inferred from secondary measurements; such as controlling concentrations using temperatures. \nFurthermore, chemical processes are generally non-linear, especially when operated in a wide range of operating conditions. Hence, these processes need to be controlled using non-linear controllers. The obstacle that Professor Budman\u2019s work seeks to overcome when designing non-linear controllers is to obtain a simple model of the processes under study. Typical processes studied are bioreactions, solidification of metal, cells and tissues. \nIn addition to his research work, Professor Budman has authored and co-authored over 150 journal publications in process modelling and controls with applications to biotechnology and reaction systems. He also co-authored the book \u201cPeriodic Operations of Chemical Reactors\u201d and chaired the October 2014 Canadian Conference in Chemical Engineering.\nCanadian Conference in Chemical Engineering\nResearch interests\n process control modelling of chemical systems monitoring of chemical processes inferential sensors Process Systems Engineering Robust Control Modelling and Control of Nonlinear Processes Chemical process control Model Predictive Control Systems biology Modeling control and optimization of biological processes Metabolic flux analysis Dynamic metabolic flux models Run-to-run (batch to batch) optimization of pharmaceutical process Monitoring/Fault Detection of chemical and biological/biotechnological processes biochemical and biomedical engineering Multivariate statistical methods for monitoring and fault detection Inferential (soft) sensors \nprocess control\nmodelling of chemical systems\nmonitoring of chemical processes\ninferential sensors\nProcess Systems Engineering\nRobust Control\nModelling and Control of Nonlinear Processes\nChemical process control\nModel Predictive Control\nSystems biology\nModeling\ncontrol and optimization of biological processes\nMetabolic flux analysis\nDynamic metabolic flux models\nRun-to-run (batch to batch) optimization of pharmaceutical process\nMonitoring/Fault Detection of chemical and biological/biotechnological processes\nbiochemical and biomedical engineering\nMultivariate statistical methods for monitoring and fault detection\nInferential (soft) sensors\nEducation\n 1987, Doctorate, Mechanical Engineering, Technion -

His goal is to understand the dynamic behaviour of carbon dioxide capture plants, and to develop designs of power plants with carbon dioxide capture. Professor Croiset is also interested in multi-period optimization to predict the impact of new technologies, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, on the fleet of power generation in Ontario over the next few decades. \nCanmetENERGY, Natural Resources Canada\nProf. Croiset\u2019s interest in alternative energy sources has led him to model the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and understand charge transfer and reaction kinetics in the SOFC. This is in an effort to reduce the operating temperature range from 800-100oC to 600-700oC, as high temperatures result in fuel cell instability. His approach is to use a ceria-based electrolyte and develop carbon and sulfur tolerant anodes on metal supported SOFC. \nAnother area of Prof. Croiset\u2019s research work is in syngas/hydrogen production from natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethanol and glycerol. He is also producing high pressure hydrogen from ethanol, desulphurization using advance solvents and designing reactors and systems to produce methanol. In 2010 and 2011, he received a grant of $7,425 from the Ontario Centres of Excellence for the preliminary design of Elementa Green Methanol Waste-to-Methanol Process (Elementa). \nIn addition to his research work, Prof. Croiset has contributed to the book \u201cEnvironmentally Conscious Fossil Energy Production\u201d.\nResearch interests\n Reaction Engineering Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Syngas/Hydrogen production Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) Process simulation Reactions in Supercritical Water Green Reaction Engineering Large scale optimization of energy systems CO2 capture from large point sources \nReaction Engineering\nSolid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC)\nSyngas/Hydrogen production\nCarbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS)\nProcess simulation\nReactions in Supercritical Water\nGreen Reaction Engineering\nLarge scale optimization of energy systems\nCO2 capture from large point sources\nEducation\n 1995, Doctorate, Physical Chemistry, University of Orleans, CNRS - Laboratoire de Combustion et Systemes Reactifs 1992, Engineer Diploma, Thermal Engineering, School of Energy and Materials, University of Orleans. 1992, Diplome d'Etude Approfondie, Post graduate diploma before completing a Ph.D., Combustion Sciences, University of Orleans \n 1995, Doctorate, Physical Chemistry, University of Orleans, CNRS - Laboratoire de Combustion et Systemes Reactifs \n 1992, Engineer Diploma, Thermal Engineering, School of Energy and Materials, University of Orleans. \n 1992, Diplome d'Etude Approfondie, Post graduate diploma before completing a Ph.D., Combustion Sciences, University of Orleans \nCourses*\n CHE 102 - Chemistry for EngineersTaught in 2019 CHE 314 - Chemical Reaction EngineeringTaught in 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023 CHE 383 - Chemical Engineering Design WorkshopTaught in 2023, 2024 CHE 482 - Group Design ProjectTaught in 2023 CHE 483 - Group Design Project and SymposiumTaught in 2021 CHE 602 - Chemical Reactor AnalysisTaught in 2020, 2022, 2024 \nCHE 102 - Chemistry for EngineersTaught in 2019\nTaught in 2019\nTaught in 2019\nCHE 314 - Chemical Reaction EngineeringTaught in 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023\nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023\nTaught in 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023\nCHE 383 - Chemical Engineering Design WorkshopTaught in 2023, 2024\nTaught in 2023, 2024\nTaught in 2023, 2024\nCHE 482 - Group Design ProjectTaught in 2023\nTaught in 2023\nTaught in 2023\nCHE 483 - Group Design Project and SymposiumTaught in 2021\nTaught in 2021\nTaught in 2021\nCHE 602 - Chemical Reactor AnalysisTaught in 2020, 2022, 2024\nTaught in 2020, 2022, 2024\nTaught in 2020, 2022, 2024\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\n* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.\nSelected/recent publications\n Hamadeh H., Toor S.Y, Douglas P.L., Sarathy M., Dibble R.W. and Croiset E., Techno-Economic Analysis of Pressurized Oxy-Fuel Combustion of Petroleum Coke, Energies, 13(13), 3463-3474, 2020.

I have used analytical modelling, surveys, and simulation of taxpayer behaviour using databases of personal tax returns. I have been at the University of Waterloo since 1985. I also spent 5 years at the Department of Finance in Ottawa, including one year as Director of Personal Income Tax. This group prepared proposals for changes in personal income tax rules to be included in the annual federal budget.
