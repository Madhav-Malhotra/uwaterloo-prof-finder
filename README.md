## UWaterloo Prof Finder

This is an unofficial tool to help contact the right Prof at the University of Waterloo. It notes your areas of interest conceptually and compares those to the bios of profs at the University.

Technically, it's implemented using word embeddings in a vector store. This just means that you don't need to know specialised research buzz words to find the right person to work with.
